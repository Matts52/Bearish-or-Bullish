With trial involving men public faces Enron -- stint chief executive -- government\\'s case shift emphasis. Prosecutors focus consistently optimistic public statements Enron\\'s financial condition men qualified lies and, thus, fraud investors. Prosecutors contend Mr. Skilling, president chief architect Enron\\'s spectacular rise 1990s, lead deceiver surprise resignation August 2001. After that, Mr. Lay took task putting false information public Enron\\'s financial condition business prospects, prosecutors contend.

Typically, private-equity firms generated returns acquiring companies mix cash debt, taking private, restructuring taking public selling them. But favorable financing environment given rise high volume dividends fees, paid ahead operational turnaround, primarily aggressive issuance debt acquired companies. A spokesman Apollo, led Intelsat transaction, declined comment. In past years, private-equity firms garnered $50 billion so-called dividend recapitalizations, according Standard & Poor\\'s Corp. By contrast, virtually dividend financings years ago. As 50% returns buyout firms paid investors past years came dividends, financed new debt, according calculations private-equity firms. The pace dividends dizzying. Blackstone Group bought Celanese Corp. $3.4 billion June 2004, contributing $650 million purchase price. In months following closing, Celanese paid Blackstone $1.3 billion dividends. Meanwhile, Thomas H.

Should \"be far push things flexibility companies deal unexpected?\" asks Josh Lerner, professor Harvard Business School research performance private-equity firms. \"You reason worry [money] pulling out.\" But private-equity firms that, general, supposed do: money investors.

In addition, monitoring oversight fees charged percentage earnings, usually amounting couple million dollars year, usual fees sit boards portfolio companies. And finally, portfolio company sold taken public, private-equity firms charge termination fee. As deals overall sums involved grow, fees grow accordingly profit center right. \"The fees generally set organizations smaller,\" says Harvard\\'s Prof. Lerner.

And Sunnis initially cried foul early returns, larger main Sunni factions lately struck conciliatory pose. The election\\'s fortunate outcome Iraq baby step identity politics. Although expected main Shiite, Kurdish Sunni parties well, hoped stronger showing pan-sectarian parties.

That holds -- especially -- succeed gaining control oil-rich Kirkuk, powerful neighbors covet. The Kurds likely fare best retaining exactly status now, semi-autonomous region federal Iraq. The biggest challenge convincing Iraq\\'s Sunni Arabs new federal arrangement protect, threaten, interests. This obvious, minority Shiites dominate central government Baghdad.

The U.S., Britain, Arab League outside powers tread carefully lest encourage Iraq\\'s Sunni parties thinly veiled groups terror -- like Sinn Fein Northern Ireland Palestine Liberation Organization. If parties allowed believe threatening actually perpetrating violence bring foreign pressure accommodate Sunni demands, temptation irresistible. That\\'s President Talabani getting recently said \"we accept join terrorists night stand morning.\" On lessons-learned side, election final definitive evidence mistake U.S. British intelligence bet chips Mr. Allawi standard bearer secularism Iraq. We warned long time ex-Baathist probably hard time winning trust Iraqis traumatized Saddam Hussein. The CIA\\'s role -- simultaneously undermining Mr. Chalabi -- Iraq intelligence failures. Another lesson so-called \"proportional representation\" -- voters choose lists candidates, individual representatives -- inferior form democracy exacerbates exactly sort sectarian divisions threaten Iraq.

They know companies\\' primary mission profits, feel pressured demonstrate businesses social conscience. What follows debate topic Fred Smith Jr., president founder Competitive Enterprise Institute, free- market think tank Washington; Benjamin W. Heineman Jr., senior vice president law public affairs General Electric Co., year published Citizenship Report detailing socially responsible activities; Ilyse Hogue, director global finance campaign Rainforest Action Network, San Francisco-based group aims marketplace friendlier environment. The debate moderated Carol Hymowitz, senior editor management issues The Wall Street Journal. Here excerpts debate. To discussion -- reader comments -- WSJ.com/Reports. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Aren\\'t businesses spend profits social issues, global warming avoiding pollution improving education eliminating poverty, robbing investors returns? And companies \"social conscience,\" issues problems responsible for? MR. HEINEMAN: You answer question context definition corporate citizenship corporate social responsibility (and I view phrases synonomous). There elements Corporate Citizenship view -- interrelated. 1. Strong, sustained economic performance. 2. Rigorous compliance financial legal rules. 3. Ethical citizenship actions, formal requirements, advance corporation\\'s reputation long-term health. The question goes element. But decisions ethical citizenship actions laws require turn specific issue whether, matter risk-reward analysis, advances \"enlightened self-interest company.\" For example, company citizenship action helps retain employees hire best new generation, practicing nondiscrimination globe, laws nations require position. The question, candor, answered abstract. MS. HOGUE: The question presupposes narrow short-term definition \"returns\" stubborn adherence outdated model economics, views ecological realities separate economic ones inhibiting. The business leaders poised leap new century understand opportunity innovation. Harvard Business Review distinguished CSR [corporate social responsibility] social innovation Rosabeth Moss Kanter called companies \"vanguard new paradigm,\" recent studies begun conclude companies outperforming peers marketplace. MR. SMITH: Ben\\'s comments reasonable but, course, suggest CSR rational profit maximization (a definition I find acceptable). I\\'ve found useful consider business operating worlds: private competitive marketplace political bureaucratic sphere. -- In Private World, business must, course, attentive groups trust goodwill essential economic success. These include shareholders employees, customers, suppliers neighbors. All groups reason push win/win arrangements. They own, work for, buy from, sell live plans goodwill useful minimize costs business. Bad relations groups (and will) impact line. Thus, \"community relations\" useful, careful \"fact-based communication\" strategy inform groups when/if mishap occurs. Corporate good-neighbor polices good idea. -- However, political sphere -- people\\'s opinions firm and, thus, firm\\'s vulnerability political predation important line -- linkage average citizen firm. In world, fact-based communication strategies proved useful private world unlikely useful. Indeed, studies attempts explain problem (to \"educate public\") raise negatives firm (\"Yes, beat wives we\\'re cutting down\" isn\\'t effective strategy gain legitimization). Yet public opinion important -- attorneys general seeking pariah firms demagogue firm seek legitimization. -- Unfortunately, CSR approach seeks generally appease critics, apologize past mistakes, bribe opponents. CSR enlightened self-interest, yes. CSR appeasement, no. MS. HOGUE: We agree Fred corporate good-neighbor policies good practice. However, globalized world, multinational corporations neighbors people places over. Yet decision making tends centralized unable absorb multitude real effects incur. Public concern corporate behavior resulted demonstrated abuse power mounting scientific evidence real impacts. Would public outcry Exxon Valdez Union Carbide Bhopal? MR. SMITH: They\\'re neighbors people world (and responsive neighbors) they\\'re neighbors anti-growth NGOs [nongoverment organizations] seek control corporations. If everybody responsible everyone, simply observe Tragedy Commons. There value civilization -- led creation specialized institutions things well. The modern firm solves (but one) major problems mankind -- creation wealth. That wealth allows individuals roles opportunity protect values care about. Competition, course, encourages efficiencies away nasty cultural traps past -- racism, fatalism, sexism, nepotism, etc. The firm civilizing influence society -- primary important role sacrificed utopian dreams. MR. HEINEMAN: With respect, Fred\\'s comments, like initial question, suffer abstract. The debates company\\'s enlightened self-interest simple. Each issue requires analysis, risk-reward considerations, broad view company\\'s interest respect stakeholders, stakeholder relations (the \"good neighbors\") affect overall health corporation. GE doesn\\'t apologize. GE acts. Two quick examples: 1) We banned public private bribery globe employees distributors. This law requires. But believe variety reasons bribery bad economics bad company -- starting proposition culture integrity company key long- term performance can\\'t culture people allowed bribe. Moreover, GE leader effort strengthen anti-corruption laws globe, early supporter (indeed founder) Transparency International, main NGO anticorruption area. 2) Ecomagination. Two dimensions. We investing hundreds millions dollars research produce technologies reduce greenhouse gases pollutants cost-effective customers. This, [GE CEO] Jeff Immelt said, good environmental policy stems good business. Green green. We committed reduction output greenhouse gases absolute basis -- growing -- increase energy efficiency 30%. This cost money. These internal commitments, environmental perspective, good step, proof statement customers technologies work economic environmental sense. MR. SMITH: CSR talks \"sustainable development,\" which, practice, means reducing use energy materials. It reality led developing world recognize foolishness \"conserve prosperity\" nonsense Kyoto. I wonder U.S. developmental cycle saw cutting east Mississippi developmental period, resource-based growth innovate create wealth return land woodlands -- viewed Rain Forest Network \"sustainable\"? MS. HOGUE: An abundance resources led practice behavior that, given increased understanding way world functions, forces different model. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment past year proved conclusively state world\\'s ecosystems greater peril previously believed, resulting lost ecosystem services needed poor people developing countries. Forest degradation Africa means clean water, farmable land, impacts hit poor harder anyone. It time explore new models factor value services tap precious asset, human creativity, solve issues way beneficial long term. MR. HEINEMAN: Again, need specific sharpen point real differences, certainly hard quarrel general idea corporations need mindful having growing, healthy society (not economy) long-term opportunities. For example, business China recognize, China\\'s leaders, balance economic growth better environmental practices society won\\'t work citizens won\\'t healthy. GE believes role play ensuring growth providing good, cost-competitive environmental technologies, e.g. wind, solar, clean coal. Rough numbers: The life expectancy male Russia 58 years, China 74. One (not only) source disease Russia poor environmental protection. With rapid industrialization, China sure doesn\\'t way Russia. That legitimate concern Chinese government, concern business wants healthy, growing and, hopefully, increasingly progressive society China. MR. SMITH: Ben need apologetic health impacts industrialization. Human lifespans increased rapidly people moved bucolic (if largely imaginary) farms England Satanic mills immortalized Dickens company. The confusion arises capitalism creates middle class -- bridge terribly poor obscenely rich. That creates social dynamic worries (not improperly) inequalities forth. Still, point remains: wealthier healthier. Russia replaced communism feudal mercantilism suffered accordingly; China India moving market liberalism lifespans increasing. Ben\\'s view GE good business policy right -- it\\'s clear. However, (like involved global warming alarmist fight) blurs \"energy efficiency\" (a good thing) \"CO2 reductions\" (a goal far costly noncarbon form energy viable). GE makes wind turbines nuclear facilities combined gas turbines -- good things -- (in short run) activities profitable anti-carbon fuel policies enacted. The temptation -- major problems GE flirting CSR movement -- justly proud technology advancement program rent-seeking regulations subsidies designed programs profitable (after taxes subsidies). MS. HOGUE: \"Corporate social responsibility\" term reflects need social institutions assure world prioritizes health justice. When governments regulate, citizens left crisis little recourse. People suffering corporations continue profit unscrupulous unsustainable behavior. Arguing responsibility sign failed imagination. We believe economic system players incentives consider decisions affect true wealth customers stakeholders. People desperate definition wealth expands centralize health individuals communities. The recent leadership seen business community best chance restore confidence corporations people understand challenges face working real solutions. WSJ: Many companies efforts socially responsible good line appeal customers help sell products. But CSR means improving returns? John Mackey, chairman Whole Foods, says company needs earn profits fulfill higher business mission improving health \"everyone planet.\" What think? MS. HOGUE: Increasingly, citizens progressive businesses recognizing false divide modern-day economic system struggling overcome. Should choose higher quarterly returns assuring health children\\'s future? More people saying no. There way both. MR. SMITH: And, course, is. Wealthier healthier.

It shrink couple years -- measured size U.S. economy -- economy keeps growing. But deficit isn\\'t going disappear significant policy changes. Indeed, it\\'s likely widen baby boom generation starts collecting Social Security Medicare benefits. Economists different political stripes agree current tax spending policy unsustainable, differ nature problem best solutions. Debating this, invitation The Wall Street Journal, Robert B. Reich, President Clinton\\'s labor secretary professor social economic policy Brandeis University; R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman President Bush\\'s Council Economic Advisers dean Columbia Business School. The discussion moderated David Wessel, The Journal\\'s deputy Washington bureau chief Capital columnist. Here excerpts debate. To discussion -- reader comments -- WSJ.com/Reports. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Has federal government bitten chew reducing tax rates beginning President Bush\\'s term subsequently -- despite costs responding 9/11, fighting war Iraq, rescuing repairing New Orleans environs, expanding Medicare cover prescription drugs? Is current fiscal policy sustainable years, major shift required? MR. HUBBARD: The U.S. economy, strong underlying rate productivity growth, excellent shape, absorb tax changes, military homeland security changes, disaster relief. Two points order, though: More restraint needed ensure domestic spending growth continue, tax reform needed codify pro-growth policy raise revenue required fund federal government. The problem years; problem long-run fiscal picture. For example, nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office tells generation, changes, spend 10 percentage points GDP Social Security Medicare today. To frame that, Bush tax cuts 1% GDP. And, pay tax increases require raising taxes 50% board, crowding economic growth. (Indeed, estimates studies tax policy economic growth suggest tax increase magnitude force entire growth dividend received recent productivity boom.) Having said this, Medicare expansion substantial reform system unwise fiscal policy. The current Social Security Medicare systems unsustainable path. In cases, sound fiscal reform involve slower benefit growth high- income households. In addition, fiscal reform Medicare accompanied reform health-care markets. The line issue guns vs. butter today (the years) butter crowd guns tomorrow (think fiscal situations continental Europe today) butter affordable terms tomorrow. MR. REICH: Undoubtedly yes. But distinguish deficits occur economy lots unused capacity -- case years Bush term -- deficits long-term structure federal budget. If tax cuts spending increases occurred start administration temporary stayed temporary, there\\'d little complain about. In fact, helped American economy moving. But administration wants tax cuts permanent. And new spending -- especially national defense, homeland security Medicare prescription drugs -- years. The drug benefit new entitlement. This isn\\'t sustainable long haul, I don\\'t think it\\'s sustainable years. While we\\'re it, let additional distinction left debates federal budget. There\\'s vast difference tax cuts spending increases merely add nation\\'s overall consumption, tax cuts spending increases add nation\\'s productive capacity. Most spending education, basic research development, health care children infrastructure, example, builds nation\\'s capacity productive future -- long it\\'s targeted. This kind spending makes enormous sense. By contrast, makes sense House Representatives cut student loans, example, extending tax cuts benefit wealthy shown improving long-term productivity. MR. HUBBARD: I agree wholeheartedly Bob dividing timeline fiscal worries parts -- short run long run -- important. I agree distinguish running deficits economy employment versus (read now). Tax cuts add nation\\'s productive capacity include reductions tax burden saving investment reductions marginal tax rates entrepreneurial activity. Recent tax cuts accomplished these, added tax cuts smaller effects economic growth. The near-term tax debate tax reform maximize opportunity pro-growth policy. On spending side, strong case continued basic research support support individualized training programs. What goes heading investment -- highways, example -- tougher case economic perspective. Where Bob I disagree regards characterization \"tax cuts benefit wealthy.\" Reductions taxation saving investment current tax distribution analysis benefiting savers -- generally well-to-do savers. Yet, long run, tax changes raise capital accumulation, productivity wages. Economists generally believe best tax rate capital income zero (though well-respected economists believe negative!). It hard imagine tax changes Bob mind add nation\\'s productive capacity. MR. REICH: I\\'m averse tax cuts savings investment, view growth tax cuts far growth well-targeted public investments education levels, health care (especially young), infrastructure, basic research development. Relative needs, nation woefully domains public investment. On hand, we\\'re hardly suffering scarcity financial capital. Indeed, world enjoying glut it. Over long term, capital flows places world highest return -- production inexpensive there, natural resources located there, (and here\\'s future come in) people enormously productive. And they\\'re productive high skills, good health, good infrastructure linking together, excellent scientific base draw. Obviously, can\\'t all. We can\\'t extend tax cuts time carry public investments necessary -- time fight wars Iraq Afghanistan, build homeland security, middle class relief alternative minimum tax, dole Medicare drug benefits (not mention rest Medicare) early boomers. Deficits matter, choices made. I\\'m skeptical claims continued tax cuts capital gains dividends hugely positive effect economy priority place choices. This recovery, example, weaker average post-World War II recovery, 2001 2003 tax cuts notwithstanding. Indeed, tax cuts appear major cause current budget deficit. So I reason extend them. According Joint Committee Taxation, proposed two-year extension capital gains dividend tax cuts reduce revenues $51 billion 2006 2015. (Of course, permanent, more.) WSJ: On taxes, believe significant tax increase wise inevitable President Bush\\'s term term successor? If so, tax whom? And spending, things government spend -- lot -- on? And things government spend -- lot -- on? MR. REICH: The president\\'s secretary Treasury, Paul O\\'Neill, wrote White House\\'s prevailing orthodoxy served \"deficits don\\'t matter.\" Apparently that\\'s philosophy. I don\\'t anticipate concerted administration tame deficit proposing Congress realistic spending cuts tax increases bond markets rattled size pending deficits White House forced come something. The best hope coalition fiscally responsible Republicans Democrats Hill refuse extend temporary tax cuts 2001 2003. That leave fiscal mess president\\'s successor, attack things right away, starting ballooning costs Medicare. What I government spend on, notwithstanding above? Early-childhood education. The evidence clear compelling expenditures provide large social returns, terms young people subsequently finish high school, avoid teenage pregnancy, stay trouble law assume productive roles society. I\\'d government spend K 12 poor communities classrooms contain 28 kids, inadequately equipped, run teachers adequate training. I\\'d favor progressive voucher system, voucher inversely related family income. What spending cut? Start subsidies tax breaks directed specific companies industries -- what\\'s commonly termed \"corporate welfare.\" Depending estimate believe, runs $60 billion $120 billion annually. Last summer\\'s energy bill cornucopia oil companies, example. Why need profits soaring? Also, rid earmarked spending specific projects. It\\'s pork. Look disgrace summer\\'s highway bill want irresponsible wasteful spending be. We need capital budget establishes clear priorities infrastructure spending. Medicare savings possible case-management techniques focus relatively small percent beneficiaries responsible costs. I\\'d amend new Medicare drug benefit allow government use huge bargaining power pharmaceutical companies push costs. MR. HUBBARD: Let echo Bob\\'s reduction corporate subsidies earmarked spending projects. With respect Paul O\\'Neill, I heard like \"deficits don\\'t matter\" administration officials, certainly President. At time, I think administration missing important opportunity talk American people enormous looming entitlement liabilities large implicit flow deficits (larger official deficit) them. If bring deficits (which conventional spending restraint economic growth control) control, raise taxes, significant adverse consequences economic growth. I believe significant tax increase wise inevitable. In context earlier remarks, I I believe scale growth entitlement programs clear present fiscal danger. I like government spend basic research training (because employment policies outdated) -- $$$ large context overall federal budget. While discretionary budget offers opportunities reductions, real area spending restraint entitlement programs. Re: Bob\\'s second reply: Blanket spending increases health care, infrastructure education strike unwise. Our goal health care improve value -- require energizing markets (tax reform, insurance reform, Medicare administrative reform, litigation reform, competition policy reform) rethinking spending. The evidence effectiveness infrastructure spending is, mildly, mixed. Even education, higher education U.S. remains envy world, primary secondary education lag; structural reform bigger deal cry money. There substantial economic evidence capital income taxes retard economic growth. MR. REICH: I\\'m suggesting \"blanket spending increases\" health care, infrastructure education. To contrary, I\\'m urging better-targeted spending vital areas. I\\'ve mentioned early childhood education and, K-12, progressive vouchers value inversely related family income. We need capital budget infrastructure spending. As health care, I\\'d recommend federal employee\\'s health-insurance system broadly accessible affordable small businesses wishing enroll employees -- giving federal system far bargaining leverage providers drug manufacturers, time enrolling large portion Americans currently health care. This step single-payer system. As entitlement spending, contrary we\\'ve heard White House, Social Security isn\\'t biggest entitlement problem. It\\'s Medicare. If constrain Medicare\\'s costs, decades spending surpass spending Social Security. The reason Medicare spending rising quickly -- apart aging population -- double-digit increases annual health-care expenditures economy. So key containing Medicare streamlining health-care system. That\\'s big topic discussion own. --- Readers asked multiple-choice question: What\\'s best way deal budget deficit? The choices: Raise taxes; Reduce spending; The deficit isn\\'t problem. Through yesterday afternoon, 5,647 people voted, 73% preferring lower government spending, 23% opting higher taxes, 4% arguing budget deficit isn\\'t problem. Here selected reader comments issue. Stop borrowing money; pass law requiring Congress spend 90% revenues; 10% paying national debt. It difficult first, people generally understand greater public good, along. I say, cut soft spending pork projects entitlements preserve scientific research, space exploration, programs long-term benefit country. Yeah, dream on! --- I\\'m flummoxed living denial presented viable option here. Saying deficit isn\\'t problem like denying existence home mortgage, works fine bank forecloses house. --- By means budget deficit reduced raising taxes. Raising taxes lowers economic development -- line. Lowering taxes actually increases revenue government. Congress Bush need skids spending Bush needs backbone start vetoing absurd spending measures. All making people reliant government. --- We discussing budget-deficit health-care issues long time able solve them; reason simple -- political guts wholesale changes health- care industry -- vested interests; window dressing patch work going job. You eliminate Medicare health-care industry allow it, ignore senior citizens. Will muster Political Guts? I doubts; I consider discussions merely excercise futility. What U.S. tax system needs \"creative destruction.\" Are ready it? --- To quote Sam Ewing, \"The government deficit difference money government spends nerve collect.\" The best way deal deficit nerve. Nerve. Takes lot nerve spend neighbor\\'s money. Takes nerve borrow neighbor\\'s spend money. Does deficit cowards all? --- It time seriously cut spending. Americans expect government pay everything. We save prepare futures, loss job, retirement, illness, family member, etc. We don\\'t latest cars large homes. It time live means. The capital-gains taxes raised ordinary income tax rates reduced. Why Bill Gates pay 15% taxes stock makes wealth income? The tax code simplified. The complicated is, IRS people, tax attorneys, accountants, etc. hired. This waste drain valuable resources contribute GDP. --- The way reduce deficit government slash spending. The government wastes money Washington accountable spending. Unfortunately, long politicians think away passing other\\'s bills, continue rack massive expenditures. The American people demand accountability. --- Bush created problem giving tax breaks. I Bush\\'s tax break buy barbeque. What joke. --- Well, buy something, good. You managed add Home Depot\\'s coffers (or bought barbeque), turn able hire person, buy stuff, on. So, added money-go-round, intent tax cut place. --- I think you\\'re letting John Q. Public easy place blame politicians. There millions voters demand, \"Cut taxes!\" But voters heard ask politician, \"Please cut mother\\'s Medicare,\" \"Please don\\'t pave roads,\" \"Don\\'t subsidize interest kids\\' student loans,\" \"Don\\'t bother bailing pension,\" \"Can stop regulating mutual-fund manager?\" People want taxes cut else\\'s government services benefits suffer consequences. --- Common defense (soldiers cops courts), health standards, roads. We afford that. The rest, sorry say, Uncle Sugar\\'s job. Not health care, dole programs stripes, market modulation (Say there, Mister Farmer! Want double income? Just second mailbox!), global conferences, Panic Month. Given percent income, central planners fill days bread circuses speculative exercises (how grievously thoughts injure Mother Earth? Should government pay surgeons add additional legs people believe space creatures trapped Earthling bipedal bodies?) -- real life productive demographic. Taking spending busting it\\'s busting Old Europe. Ready match higher suicide rates? Bored clean, efficient, energetic, fair culture? Look EU, progressives. Better still, move! --- Simple. The Fair Tax -- lose inefficient, costly, intrusive arm government system corporate graft inherent tax code dramatically boosting economy governmental efficiency. It\\'s answer politicians don\\'t want hear talk castrates tax-break-for-campaign-contributions lobby system vaporizes years carefully crafted loopholes. --- I wish included \"raise taxes reduce spending\" response. Both needed. The government save ton money quitting Bush\\'s stupid war Iraq, shutting unworkable Star Wars program, gutting appropriations Alaskan bridge similar examples Congressional pork. To bring budget balance, however, government needs revenue. At least, unfair, unjustified Bush tax cuts repealed. The usual suspects whine raising taxes crush economy, nonsense. Go look marginal tax GDP growth rates Kennedy administration. Uncle Sam big bills pay. They paid, way another, someone. It best cut spending took gifts granted people need, deserve, them. --- If taxed rich 100%, run federal government months rich tax. --- Sacrifice necessary. We need statesmen politicians moment. Bush needs tell Congress I accept: Make cuts I shut thing down. I know politically unacceptable, economic security country stake statesman comes in, politician. Higher taxes answer. They impede economic growth taking productive sectors society. Sacrifice levels needed. Entitlements, defense, education, everything. Everyone says cuts can\\'t understand debt burden gets great, choice; areas cut regard whining crying pain greater. --- As easily see, America great consumer society. Therefore, conservation American leadership antithetically limiting career-wise. For example, Congressman Jose Serrano campaigned year on, \"I voted bringing money Bronx reduce federal budget,\" gain votes? Perhaps, like weight, brought ourselves. --- I 4% voters poll intelligent realize deficit isn\\'t problem. It wasn\\'t problem Reagan one, isn\\'t problem now. It\\'s scare tactic. And looks poll, apparently working. --- The equitable efficient way substantial dent pending Social Security liability remove tax ceiling FICA collections. --- Eliminate present tax system national sales tax approach European countries use. It easier adjust rate (and change revenue stream) wars tax system. It fairer harder avoid (the consume pay). To help lower-income families, tax rates items food, clothing (with limits), etc. The approach: Stop trying export democracy nations going war accomplish it. --- We, American people start holding elected officials accountable! The list waste, inefficiency fraud mile long. We\\'ve read heard stories. It\\'s time American people tear away \"Oprah\" \"Desperate Housewives\" start spending time paying attention what\\'s going on. One government\\'s priorities safeguard scarce resources have. They spend money wisely. If start paying attention play active role government better. Read article hear news story send letter email member Congress complain!! Get atention. Tell you\\'re keeping eye them. Need incentive? The time paid look gross pay versus net pay. Everything taken government. And spent what?? --- I suspect chosen \"both\" given option. I means-test entitlements-expense board, revenue side. No way retired rich (and I expect them) Medicare Social Security. No way rich farmers (and I relatives group) crop subsidies. And way let lobbyists hide chicanery bribing Congress manipulate tax code. Make progressive deduction- exemption-free. If Congress thinks need subsidize Exxon-Mobil hunt oil, I want write check, I want Exxon-Mobil report income, used. --- I didn\\'t vote correct answer isn\\'t available: Call Constitutional Convention eliminate houses Congress let states\\' legislatures vote directly federal laws point forward. Since won\\'t happen, answer reduce spending increase taxes. In addition, income taxes business eliminated entire tax burden placed voters. This immediate triple impact dramatically stimulating economy, eliminating need business lobbyists making lawmakers responsible tax burden place voters. --- I don\\'t believe taxes raised, say, \"tax rich,\" think paying taxes now? The tax-the-rich-gimmick gets pay-for-service system I think find rich use resources -- rich don\\'t use public schools, public transportation, public welfare health-care programs -- pay it. It\\'s class warfare. --- Taxing investment savings totally disincentivizes investing savings; reducing available capital growth companies. Same thing income taxes; income taxed, disincentivizes work. People work harder productive actually work for. This revenues eventually right tax cuts (read: credits loopholes), initial decline. Why think GDP increasing 4% 10 straight quarters? The 2001 2003 tax cuts. --- Reduce government spending. That isn\\'t likely happen long GOP controls White House houses Congress. The GOP likes spend tax dollars Democrats did, different spending prioities. The deficit isn\\'t going reduced fiscally [responsible] Republicans and/or centrist Democrats power. --- Continuing deficits eliminated politicians longer power spend taken. A constitutional amendment requiring balanced budgets required acheive long-term solution. Otherwise, expect downward spiral continue. --- To fix problem U.S. be, constitutional republic kept government small taxes low. The path seen U.S. faltering empire lead ruin. You need eliminate welfare programs, bring troops back, eliminate Federal Reserve wisdom American Founding Fathers. But takes courage determination short supply. --- It easy answer \"Raise Taxes.\" It difficult solution \"Reduce Spending.\" It true solution reduce spending simply pushing cost state local governments raise taxes compensate new cost. Our governments -- federal, state local -- find way truly cut cost. The waste obvious time. --- Will Rogers said, \"Be thankful aren\\'t geting government we\\'re paying for.\" I\\'m afraid Will concerned vast government people today crave. When vote taxes, saying government solution -- want it! I prefer empower people letting retain wealth, putting Uncle Sam diet order fiscal shape. --- Voters reflexively cut spending won\\'t realize magnitude problem it\\'s given -- example, balance budget cutting spending in, say, 2025 require virtual elimination Social Security Medicare. If voters said reduce spending \"solve problem\" aware solving deficit spending cuts result, I reasonably confident they\\'d change mind they\\'d both. The true raise taxes cutting entitlements. To eventually doubling income tax share GDP, obviously infeasible. --- Want lower deficit? Cut taxes. Want raise revenues? Cut taxes. Want create jobs? Cut taxes. Want increase capital spending? Cut taxes. Want recovery strong? Cut taxes. Want compete China? Cut taxes. I think point. --- The government perform functions: 1. Protection foreign invasion protection U.S. foreign interests. 2. Enforcement contracts. 3. Infrastructure construction highways I concede function reluctantly. The government else. No welfare, social security, education, antitrust, business regulations, farm subsidies, tariffs. If government intended wealthier deficit. --- Term limits, years max Senators Congressman. One six- year term President. The longer representatives stay, effective persuaded become. We can\\'t fix budget fix process system budgets created. --- Whatever question, answer cut taxes. --- I tell what. I trade 1% piddling middle-class income $67,500. I gladly pay higher taxes net income people 1% have. If class warfare, it. The system dramatically stacked favor rich. Anyone 1% feels treated unfairly crying crocodile tears. --- Remarkable -- Roman Emperor Caligula imperial decrees written small letters posted high citizens read know law. The U.S. government posts budgetary infomation way citizens read know truth public treasure. The best way, then, treat question obligation clearly known, American citizens insist return rule law property right, contracts honored, artifical favorites enjoying artifical benefits state. This idle dream. It deeply embedded history United States. --- The biggest problem reason hard balance budget year deficit doesn\\'t matter. So, politicians spend mone',\n",

       " 'CONSUMERS ARE increasingly asked bear costs responsibility health care, growing trend called consumer-driven health care, CDHC. Congress gave CDHC big boost years ago creating health savings accounts -- tax-favored accounts consumers employers deposits routine health-care expenses. When money runs out, patient spends money high- deductible insurance policy (with deductibles $1,500 individual policies $3,500 family policies) kicks cover big-budget medical bills. Backers arrangement patients cost-conscious judicious use medical service, restraining health-cost increases; critics cause patients defer needed treatment attractive younger, healthier workers. Debating issue American Enterprise Institute scholar Joseph Antos, assistant director health human resources Congressional Budget Office; John C. Goodman, founder president National Center Policy Analysis; Robert Reischauer, president Urban Institute vice chairman Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. The debate moderated Laurie McGinley, assistant bureau chief The Wall Street Journal\\'s Washington bureau. Here excerpts debate. To discussion -- reader comments -- WSJ.com/Reports. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Who right? Is CDHC solution -- -- rising health-care costs? Do consumers access information cost quality providers good judgments? Will needed care? What criticisms CDHC doesn\\'t problem real high-cost items -- hospitalizations expensive drugs -- covered high-deductible insurance? MR. GOODMAN: Consumer-driven health care shifting costs employees. It instead shifting money employers employees, employees manage health-care dollars. It true employers shifting costs employees charging higher premiums raising deductibles co-payments. These activities constitute consumer-driven health care. CDHC patient power -- having patients often-difficult choices health care uses money instead having choices large, impersonal bureaucracies. More decade experience South Africa, seven years experience Medical Savings Account pilot program country, 3 1/2 years experience Health Reimbursement Arrangements, years experience Health Savings Accounts produced evidence patients skimping needed health care. MR. ANTOS: Most people health insurance pays nearly cost health services, including routine affordable care. That creates economists \"moral hazard,\" means consumers purchase health services fully aware true cost. Moreover, health-care providers little incentive limit use services marginal improvement patient\\'s condition, knowing party paying bill. Moral hazard contributed unsustainably rapid growth health spending country. Consumer-driven health care approach break health inflationary spiral making consumers aware costs. When people realize spending money, likely interested money spent. CDHC puts premium information cost, quality, effectiveness care. That information needed thoughtful consumers, CDHC. Consumerism adding pressure employers Medicare exists produce information. Electronic patient records integrated national health-information system keys developing information. Even information, patients need advice physicians treatment alternatives, lifestyle changes actions contribute better health. Simply imposing economic incentive reduce use care sufficient taking steps improve decision making consumers health-care providers. WSJ: Aren\\'t assuming consumers habit seeking unnecessary medical care, employer-provided insurance paying bills? But consumers time inclination that? MR. REISCHAUER: One major problems facing nation\\'s health-care system rapidly rising health-care costs. It unlikely, however, consumer-driven health care prove significant solution problem. First foremost, Americans enrolled CDHC plans, usually form high-deductible catastrophic plans supplemented health reimbursement arrangement (HRA) health savings account (HSA), likely find options attractive future. While options relatively new, latest survey evidence estimates fewer 4% workers enrolled arrangements half employers express little interest offering plans. This situation change employers continue hit premium costs rise double triple rate wage increases. Certainly, employers continue increase cost sharing (deductibles coinsurance/co-pays), trend likely re-establish cost-sharing burdens prevalent decades ago constitute movement true CDHC. Whatever outcome, trend shift costs health care sick, especially chronic conditions, larger families, older workers, reduce burden young, healthy singles. To effective equitable, CDHC requires educated consumers, sophisticated information infrastructure, complex mechanisms subsidizing premiums determining contributions individuals\\' health spending accounts. None exists now. While consumers use Internet sources educate health issues, vast majority willing advice provider. Accessible information quality, price, effectiveness efficiency health-care services providers developing rapidly, near minimum standard assumed well-functioning CDHC. And employers, bound Treasury Department regulations, vary deductibles, catastrophic caps contributions HSAs HRAs workers\\' family incomes health status equitable CDHC for. MR. GOODMAN: It chronically ill greatest opportunity use Health Savings Accounts control costs improve quality. Bob Reischauer right thing: advantage opportunity, employers need able risk-adjusted deposits employees\\' accounts. But way underestimating potential market respond expansion patient power. Currently, patients pay 10 cents pocket time spend dollar physicians\\' services. Health care free U.S. Canada Great Britain. In countries, patients mainly paying care time, money. Rationing waiting special disadvantages chronically ill. By contrast, system price rationing, providers vigorously compete solve problems ignored current system. MR. ANTOS: Health insurance pays dollar cost care people employer-sponsored insurance, time major cost seeking medical services. The time cost greater barrier treatment money working people (but typically issue nonworking dependents). That motivates demand expensive medical procedures promise recovery time expensive treatment \"watchful waiting\" (no treatment continued observation patient heal own) well. Since additional cost high-tech medicine typically modest insurance, rational personal decision clear cost treatment times cost aggressive intervention. The additional cost spread insurance, drives premiums up, patient provider weighs societal costs benefits. If additional services highly valuable, issue. However, Dr. Jack Wennberg colleagues Dartmouth shown health spending associated worse health outcomes patients, better outcomes. Clearly, financial incentives third-party payment promote additional treatment that, margin, provide little value. WSJ: What Bob\\'s point sufficient information doesn\\'t exist consumers educated choices health care? Doesn\\'t mean they\\'re dependent doctor information? How consumers supposed bargain doctors better prices -- find doctors offer better prices quality -- information isn\\'t available? MR. GOODMAN: That patients information price quality natural inevitable consequence rationing waiting. Since patients aren\\'t paying prices, reason care, doctors compete patients price system. Doctors compete patients making quality adjustments. That 80% primary-care physicians maintain computerized patient records, despite enormous potential systems prevent errors secure better outcomes. Price information quality improvements, contrast, normal find price rationing. In market cosmetic surgery, package prices normal price comparisons easy thanks fact third-party payers market years. It worth noting real price cosmetic surgery went 1990s price lasik surgery reasons. MR. ANTOS: We years away kind information infrastructure needed efficient health-care system kind. At present, nearly impossible find advance health service cost compare cost health plans providers. It equally difficult find consumer-friendly information treatment alternatives success doctor treating condition. Suppose, however, information gap filled. Would consumer-driven system mean turn medical experts aggressive bargainers? No. In truly consumer-driven system, people able choose personal control wish exercise health care, pay additional cost less-efficient health plan offered amenities. The market shaped prepared change health plans new better option emerged. Perhaps 10% 20% empowered consumers change direction private health system. WSJ: Some people health savings accounts consumer- directed health care restrain costs smaller items, visits doctors\\' offices, big-ticket items like hospitalizations expensive drugs, end covered high-deductible insurance policy. What\\'s view why? MR. GOODMAN: Currently, deposits Health Savings Accounts relatively small. However, course work-life, balance accounts grow large, HSAs potentially factor health-care decision -- expensive services. WSJ: So, here\\'s way frame debate: With health costs rising, pay -- government, employers consumer? Mr. GOODMAN: Someone choose health care uses money. In future, choices increasingly difficult. Ask like decision case. The government? Your employer? Or, like decisions yourself? In choosing alternatives, remember: No cares care you. So retain power decisions control money pay decisions, end day system likely work better cede money power impersonal bureaucracy. MR. ANTOS: Directly indirectly, workers pay health insurance. Benefits simply compensation, higher insurance costs mean wage increases lower. Shifting high-deductible plan shift costs employees group, costs apparent. The $150 billion-plus tax break employer-sponsored health insurance comes largely workers, pay higher taxes receive fewer government services would. Low- income people pay less, high-income people pay -- high-income people enjoy larger tax benefit. If ask employers government pay middle-class insurance, simply means lower wages higher taxes employees. That means, John Goodman indicates, decisions one\\'s health care else. That result choice health plans restrictions person spend money -- surely desirable outcome. People low incomes health conditions need special assistance ensure purchase health coverage. That forcing one-size-fits-all government programs. As matter sound policy social justice, redirect government subsidies better focused need help most. Capping federal tax exclusion employer-sponsored coverage important step direction. MR. REISCHAUER: Widespread adoption CDHC certainly bit restrain growth costs services, pharmaceuticals devices curb demand. But impact likely small evident lower-price items billed separately components larger service packages. The limitations approach cost control significant stem number factors including: -- Many things buy health care pieces larger packages, undefined decisions concerning purchase purchase. For example, goes doctor particular set symptoms, doctor asks number questions lead series recommended tests results determine appropriate treatment regime. One select doctor visit basis price quality guarantee package tests treatments resulted lowest cost highest quality. -- The costs expensive treatments largely unaffected needing major interventions usually condition \"shop around\" incentives limited because, margin, costs picked catastrophic policy. Reference pricing represents sensible approach curbing cost growth. Under system, basic insurance cover (with modest co-insurance) cost efficiently provided service met acceptable quality standards. If individual wanted more, better amenity-rich care, pay pocket health account. For example, cheapest therapeutically equivalent lipid-lowering drugs cost $30, wanting cost $50 pay $20 difference co-pay required $30 drug. Of course, system requires information quality, cost-effectiveness efficiency available; information necessary CDHC function missing MR. GOODMAN: Bob\\'s idea reference pricing modest suggestion create modest improvements. We need radical. We need replace rationing waiting rationing price, similar market. Only vibrant, innovative marketplace keeps cost quality up. MR. ANTOS: Bob suggests content health care transparent consumer structure insurance cover lowest-priced service meets minimal quality standards. Consumers free pay more, guaranteed basic level treatment. That approach reasonable (with caveats) far goes, address larger cost driver: escalating capita use health services. We need marginally valuable health services, incentives current insurance system difficult. Reference pricing biased development new health services produce better results higher price. Clinical trials, likely source information relative effectiveness new service, narrowly focused reveal range potential health benefits offered new health service. Reference pricing allows consumer buy yesterday\\'s technology yesterday\\'s prices (in Mark Pauly\\'s terminology), prevent consumers buying today\\'s technology today\\'s prices. MR. REISCHAUER: With health costs rising, people picking tab. The question is, hats like wear money table? When government subsidizes added costs, taxpayers -- current future -- pay bill; employers absorb costs, workers ultimately bear burden form lower wages non-health compensation; consumers asked pay increment form higher insurance premiums increased cost sharing. Of course, distribution different types people -- rich vs. poor, healthy vs. sick workers vs. nonworkers -- varies greatly depending hat worn. As John Goodman points out, real issue determine uses added resources put. In past, little focus issue allowed collective drift channel incremental resources. We stronger health-care system future, individuals louder voice decision. But appropriate incentives needed safeguards limited incomes significant health problems. I find Joe\\'s criticism reference pricing -- prevent consumers buying today\\'s technology today\\'s prices -- bit perplexing. Reference pricing puts barriers way letting people spend money purchase new services conclude worth costs. Isn\\'t principle CDHC? Of course, rising living standards I expect quality threshold set rise year. When new interventions cost-effective old treatments developed, incorporated basic coverage. When new interventions significantly effective (but necessarily cost-effective) older treatments developed, debate wanted afford higher quality incorporated basic coverage. Unfortunately, pay weak evidence base. As result, health care better and, geographic areas, worse. Notwithstanding public\\'s desire bring promising new development line immediately, demand convincing evidence new interventions effective older ones cost- effective promise cover third-party payments. MR. ANTOS: This attempt clarification. A new service emerge market regulatory barriers posed reference pricing high, service great potential improve health outcomes (although higher price existing treatments). I agree Bob service available, people decide worth higher price (assuming good information consultation physician). But narrowly focused evaluation effectiveness miss benefits, lack complete information skew consumer/physician decisions. If bias expected potential innovator (such drug company), reduce willingness innovator risk huge sums money development product service. I agree basic standard care rise time, risky R&D discouraged evaluation process seen flawed. As Bob said, situation today worse, little evidence up. Of course, modern regulatory standards, aspirin market today effects true wonder drug. There\\'s clearly risk going far direction. --- Readers asked multiple-choice question: Who bear main burden health-care costs? The choices: Consumers; Employers; The government. Through yesterday afternoon, 2,623 people voted, 60% preferring consumers, 28% saying government 13% voting employers. Here selected reader comments issue. I said government, government, burden falls us. There wide variety types universal health care world, purely government run, private contract government. Surely fit needs. Something insured. It doesn\\'t matter aren\\'t insured can\\'t afford it, think invincible. They coverage. --- I believe government bear cost health- care system country. Employers overburdened consumers afford onerous costs. Keep mind Medicare works military\\'s system. --- There party bears burden: consumer. Consumers paid employers pay government, \"employer\" pays \"government\" pays, consumer pays. If \"employer\" pays, pays reducing employee\\'s wage. If \"government\" pays, pays taxes taken employee. Someone making $38,000 year plus $15,000 health-insurance coverage making \"only\" $38,000 year, nominally $53,000. So eliminate health insurance deductible, nontaxable \"benefit\" employee -- including employees, private industry, Congress, White House, military government employ (including teachers) -- incorporate \"benefit\" wages. And concept \"single provider\" anathema many, \"single provider\" means national health insurance (egads!), eliminate \"discounting\" medical providers insurance companies. If brain transplant costs $100, costs $100. Not $75 insurance $150 don\\'t. --- Believe not, taxpayer (city/county/state federal) pays 45% total medical costs U.S. These programs Medicare, Medicaid, VA, U.S. military, subsidy hospital construction, education doctors, health-care workers medical research, public health, etc. Many community hospitals subidized local taxpayers. Tax deductions medical expenses employer-paid premiums add layer tax subsidy. If (almost) socialism, tell solcialism is? Government provide services, pay them. --- If employers raise salaries sufficiently buy health care, pay higher taxes higher salary, leaving employer originally intended health-care purchase. Business tax break providing insurance. Since businesses don\\'t want pay large percentage annual increase premiums, pay increases salary year year? If not, won\\'t able afford insurance either. If consumers purchase health care, America want WalMart prices, WalMart no-frills health care. No cutting-edge brain surgery, new cures paralysis. Just Band-Aids aspirin. We going discuss rationing. Unfortunately, means rich poor little, that\\'s system now. Can afford orphan drugs? Can afford 100-year-olds feeding tubes? Will nation choose spend $1 million health-care premature baby? We need serious, sound-bite, discussion issues order set reform motion. --- In end way things going, government step in. We society health care dependent personal economics. This hit home middle America, average family struggling current share health- care costs. It control. --- 1) We medical industry great redistributor wealth. Quite surprise think children benefit eliminating inheritance tax. It gobbled nursing home/assisted living/prescription costs. 2) We introduce socialized medicine. My, my, my, cyberspace I hear sharp intake breath. No need quote failure socialized medicine country tried it, I know. It choice evils, solution. 3) We hope gets sick. The popular far. And long memories classics, evil come Pandora\\'s box? Delusive false hope. --- It\\'s accident world, health care financed social insurance results income transfer young healthy old poor. The underlying rationale unlike forms insurance, consumer health care live long enough. Having healthy cross subsidize sick makes sense situation. Given median household income U.S. $44,000 national savings rate low, simply economically feasible think average Americans going able finance health care. Some consumer exposure health- care costs level probably good idea, long doesn\\'t discourage individuals obtaining needed care. However, third-party payment, employment-based government-based, prerequisite modern innovation-based health-care system. --- The consumer bear burden free-market system able shop best medical value dollars. Once competition enters equation, costs (prices) drop services continue improve. As stands now, consumer medical \"credit card\" receive bill end month, \"cost\" little importance demand best regard cost. However, receive \"bill\" end month, find cost-effective solutions health- care needs. --- The consumer can\\'t afford health-care costs. I think ways view question. The fair way thinking employer benefiting successful business diligence labor force, small compensation health-care insurance small reward. Another view preservation human race: Since health care expensive, affording basic [care] cause plague, case loses. Last, 1% 99% wealth, man selfish provide support wealthy? Or let eat cake? --- The issue sorted basic care, premium care privileged care. All provided basic care government, equalizing financial resource all. This basic care cover immunization, physicals, catastrophic care breaks/communicable diseases/basic levels treatment cancers/chronic illnesses. This basic care meet minimum expectations rationing/waiting time. Meanwhile, people offered elective choices enable reach specialists choice, enabling receive higher standard care shorter waiting times provided basic programs. This provided system like current insurance system, employer-funded employee- funded, way tax benefits offered equally both. I\\'d \"premium\" care level. I expect insurers offer, people privately arrange, coverage top-notch hospitals facilities. This coverage carry tax advantage. --- There problems health care: funding risk. Most \"solutions\" confuse two. Related problems paying pay, paying teaching hospitals (paying train new doctors paying research). The risk problem handled insurance. This eventually government program require universal coverage (healthy people opt out). It high-deductible plan (e.g. $5,000 family) deductible indexed inflation. The coverage deductible 100% limits prevent abuse. Those afford premiums subsidized Medicaid. The funding problem (amounts deductible) addrssed directly. In general, expenses paid consumer. There pay. However, funding level expenses different necessities (housing, food, etc.), treated way. This separate decision insurance coverage, overall welfare benefits covered, generally state level. The extra cost paying teach new doctors cost research funded [the National Institutes Health]. I believe way control utilization inflation health care keeping risk funding problems separate. Anything free abused, today\\'s plans effectively allow insured treat cost care free, close free. While argue universal government program, I think choice end rest world operates way, lose key industries. --- If rely government maintain health, expect age gracefully New Orleans. --- Regardless resources available it, source, consumed. When demand insatiable, supply follow money runs out. Attempts limit health-care expenditures HMO creation, legislation, rationing, capping, cost shifting, bargaining, denying coverage, venue shifting (to outpatient home) distorted system caused hardship. They haven\\'t controlled costs, won\\'t long health care \"right\" \"fairness\" dictates availability.

Lucian Bebchuk, Harvard Law scholar executive-pay practices, published study fall Cornell\\'s Yaniv Grinstein attempts measure pay portion earnings. The results eye- opening: From 1999 2003, dogs 1,500 largest publicly traded firms cumulatively took $122 billion salary, bonus stock, compared $68 billion 1993 1997. That\\'s real money measure, percentage earnings, it\\'s downright astonishing: In period 2001 2003, top- executive compensation amounted 9.8% companies\\' net income, double 5% 1993 1995.

So executives\\' share equity actually going companies giving overall. To me, it\\'s irrefragable CEOs overpaid. Top-executive pay rising faster inflation faster average worker\\'s salary.

       " 'Two trends emerged broad shift away traditional pensions, provide workers set benefits based salary years service. Financially strapped companies airlines auto makers garnering attention seek ditch badly underfunded pension liabilities try stay afloat. Meanwhile, relatively healthy companies -- fully paid-up pension plans -- seeking shift retirement programs burden savings planning employees. Last week, International Business Machines Corp. informed 117,000 workers U.S. pension plans stop earning additional benefits 2007, saving estimated $2.5 billion $3 billion years process, including impact changes. Verizon Communications Inc. froze pension 50,500 managers month, saving $3 billion coming decade. Effective Jan. 1, workers Hewlett-Packard Co. Sears Holdings Corp. stopped building benefits plans. The companies said enhancing 401(k) plans, typically involve employee contributions matched employers. Current interest rates offer employers possibility particularly big income boost freeze pensions, effectively wiping debt owed future retirees. While assets plan paid workers retire leave company, benefits don\\'t grow additional years job. There legal barrier freezing pension prohibited union contract. Verizon, example, unilaterally froze pensions managers, changes pensions union employees subject negotiations. \"I wouldn\\'t surprised largest [companies] fact evaluating\" pension freezes, said Vadim Zlotnikov, chief investment strategist Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Mr. Zlotnikov says potential locking bigger accounting benefits reasons big pension sponsors choose freeze pension now. Under accounting rules, companies calculate expect pay pensions lives employees, including amounts workers haven\\'t earned yet, reflect liability books. When company freezes pension -- halting buildup additional benefits employees -- longer obligated payments planned. That allows company reduce value liability carrying books, generates accounting gains counted income. Although \"income\" isn\\'t money spent, affect stock price management\\'s pay incentives. Benefits consultants, earn fees helping employers restructure pension plans, begun telling clients competitors considering changes. Hewitt Associates LLC says 29% 152 companies surveyed recently considering closing pensions new employees, 16% 157 companies said freeze benefit accruals current participants. Today\\'s low long-term interest rates allow companies lock particularly high gains. The value future obligation today\\'s dollars bigger interest rates low, employer money aside prevailing rates meet payments come due. Short-term rates, contrary long-term rates trending higher recent months, offer potential bigger gains companies so-called \"cash-balance\" plans, IBM, Verizon, H-P, Sears big companies. Under plans, workers hypothetical \"accounts\" employer credits interest year, tied short-term rates. Higher short-term rates means higher interest credits. That, too, raises pension obligation, turn, savings reducing obligation. Thus, freezing U.S. plans time long- short-term interest rates creating bigger liabilities, companies stand reap bigger benefit reducing obligation. The companies lock savings today, if, like IBM, benefits won\\'t stop growing years. Meanwhile, employers worried proposed pension- accounting changes proposed Financial Accounting Standards Board profits volatile. It impossible sure companies follow footsteps IBM Verizon. Technology telecom companies Lucent Technologies Inc., BellSouth Corp. Electronic Data Systems Corp., like IBM, Verizon, H-P Sears, cash-balance plans generate gains frozen current interest-rate environment. Spokesmen companies declined comment said weren\\'t aware plans change plans. Lucent reviewing options, says person familiar matter. IBM wouldn\\'t break specific effects freezing U.S. pension, says account expected savings pension changes. Nor identify projected savings offset estimated cost increasing 401(k) contributions, company announced week well. IBM officials said company began examining pension freeze earnest early 2005, current interest-rate environment didn\\'t play role decision. Verizon too, didn\\'t disclose $3 billion savings expects come freezing pension, savings offset increased 401(k) costs. The company declined comment interest-rate environment played role decision; said decision driven merger MCI, didn\\'t offer managers pension. An H-P spokesman said company froze pension competitive reasons. \"I wouldn\\'t [interest rates] played significant role,\" said. H-P didn\\'t freeze entire plan; rather, closed younger employees new employees, similar NCR Corp., 2004. NCR cash-balance plan. Sears said froze plan traditional pensions \"become competitively unaffordable,\" cause \"significant volatility company\\'s earnings cash funding requirements.\" Companies like Sears, underfunded pension, cash savings freeze plans addition pension income boosts line.

       " 'Should health-care reform increase reliance markets, direct government involvement? The debate cast struggle employers insurance companies workers other, workers getting short end free-market stick. This view results fundamental misunderstanding basic economics. A handful policy changes harness power markets health services potential patients physicians control health-care choices, create health-insurance options, lower health costs, reduce number uninsured persons -- workers pay increase boot. Last year, pages, argued health-care policy limit, expand, government intervention. Greater reliance individual choice free markets solutions ails health-care system. As starter, recommended main proposals correct harmful effects current government policy: -- Make out-of-pocket health-care expenses deductible income taxes catastrophic insurance -- itemize deductions; -- Allow qualified insurance companies sell insurance nationwide, free politically motivated state mandates costly state- imposed regulatory practices; -- Set reasonable caps damages pain suffering medical malpractice cases. Making out-of-pocket health-care expenses tax deductible long way undoing effects misguided U.S. health- care policy -- exemption employer-provided health care income payroll taxation. The current tax exemption helped create health-care system dominated low-co-payment, employer- sponsored health plans. The tax exemption principle reason health-care dollars spent person receiving care. Quite naturally, system evolved excessively costly wasteful. Tax deductibility, expanding Health Savings Accounts, help level tax-playing field insured out-of- pocket spending. It encourage individuals rely out-of-pocket spending instead overly generous insurance finance routine health-care purchases. With \"skin game,\" individuals exert control health-care services. And, results much-analyzed RAND Health Insurance Experiment host non-experimental academic studies demonstrate, savings achieved significant adverse consequences health outcomes. But higher health-plan co-payments policy benefit workers? The answer lies U.S. economy\\'s highly competitive labor market. A worker\\'s total compensation, wages salaries plus benefits, determined value additional output worker contributes firm. An employer offers job applicant value worker\\'s output outbid worker\\'s services employer. An employer pays workers value output lose money ultimately driven business. One consequence competitive labor markets workers -- employers insurance companies -- bear burden paying employer-provided health-insurance premiums, out-of-pocket co-payments. Although employers write check premiums, workers pay end foregoing money wages. This assumption economic theory. As Jonathan Gruber writes Handbook Health Economics, empirical evidence shows costs health-insurance premiums fully shifted wages workers receive. If out-of-pocket health-care expenses tax deductible, workers demand employers provide health plans lower health-insurance premiums higher co-payments. The premium savings accrue workers form higher money wages. In past, workers borne higher cost health-insurance premiums receiving smaller wage increases. In future, proposed policy, reap benefit reduced premiums receiving larger wage increases. We estimate that, response making out-of-pocket expenses tax deductible, typical worker shift health plan 25% coinsurance rate 35% coinsurance rate. Coupled reforms, shift reduce premiums average employer-provided family health plan $2,300 year. The economics competitive labor markets ensures accrue worker form higher wages. To sure, higher out-of-pocket expenses offset increase -- $1,000 it. But leaves worker, net, $1,300 ahead. Tax deductibility persons purchase health insurance directly tax advantages available workers employer-provided health insurance. The new tax treatment insurance costly unemployed persons workers firms don\\'t offer insurance coverage. Under current law, persons deduct cost health insurance individually purchase out-of-pocket health- care expenses. Under proposal, person able deduct both, purchased insurance. Thus, person 15% tax bracket purchases health-insurance plan $2,000 additional $700 out-of-pocket expenses realize tax savings $405, effectively reducing net cost buying insurance 20%. This lower cost provides significant financial incentive currently uninsured individuals buy insurance protects catastrophic health-care expenses. The reasoning applies policy reforms. We propose allow insurance companies sell insurance nationwide, free politically-motivated state benefits mandates forms excessive regulation. A national market health insurance costly portable. There 1,500 specific coverage requirements imposed insurance markets state legislatures. Although benefits freely chosen consumers, others, chiropractic care, be. According Congressional Budget Office, state benefit mandates raised cost typical insurance plan 5% 15%. Allowing individuals instead state legislatures decide insurance coverage best value money. We recommend adoption reasonable caps damages pain suffering medical malpractice cases. This reduce practice \"defensive medicine\" -- expensive tests procedures minimal medical benefit undertaken fear legal liability. As reforms effect, premiums decline. For employer-provided insurance, wages rise; currently uninsured, insurance affordable. Reductions insurance costs, accompanied increases deductibles co-payments, look like redistribution workers employers. Competitive labor markets, however, ensure workers ultimately receive benefits. Politicians policy makers sides aisle wise fact mind considering direction health-care reform. And simple observation suggests clear routes Bush administration forth reforms markets work better. Absent changes, high rates uninsurance rising health-care costs ultimately lead government-directed health care program, adverse consequences choice innovation. --- Mr. Cogan, deputy director Office Management Budget, Leonard Shirley Ely Senior Fellow Hoover Institution.

But real issue national security: FISA adept detecting -- and, thus, preventing -- terrorist attack horse-and-buggy getting New York Paris. I extensive experience consequences government bungling over-strict interpretations FISA. As chief counsel Senate Intelligence Committee 1981 1984, I participated oversight FISA years passage. When I subsequently deputy assistant attorney general Reagan administration, responsibilities terrorism portfolio, included working FISA. In 1985, I experienced pain terminating FISA wiretap defied common sense thwarted possibility gaining information American hostages. During TWA 847 hijacking, American serviceman Robert Stethem murdered remaining American male passengers taken hostage. We previously placed tap U.S. thought possibility learn hostages\\' location. But Justice Department career lawyers told FISA statute defined \"primary purpose\" foreign intelligence gathering. Because crimes taking place, FBI shut wire. FISA\\'s \"primary purpose\" basis \"wall\" 1995, Clinton-Gore Justice Department prohibited intelligence communicating law enforcement. The Patriot Act corrected problem FISA appeals court upheld constitutionality amendment, characterizing rigid interpretation \"puzzling.\" The court cited FBI agent\\'s testimony efforts investigate Sept. 11 hijackers blocked senior FBI officials, concerned FISA rule requiring separation. Today, FISA remains ill-equipped deal ever-changing terrorist threats. It envisioned speedy collector information prevent imminent attack soil. And reasons president decide bypass FISA courts readily understandable, easy conjure scenarios like TWA hijacking, strict adherence FISA jeopardize American lives. The overarching problem FISA, written 1978, technologically antediluvian. It drafted legislators concept terrorists communicate 21st century technology invented intercept communications. The rules regulating acquisition foreign intelligence communications drafted targets monitored telephone number residence phones plugged wall. Critics like Al Gore especially critics Congress, carp, address gaps created law governs peacetime communications-monitoring address computers, cell phones fiber optics midst war.

And correct oft-cited misconception, five-minute \"emergency\" taps. FISA requires extensive time-consuming procedures. To prepare two-to-three-inch thick applications non-emergency warrants takes months. The so-called emergency procedure hours, let minutes. The attorney general going approve emergency FISA intercept based breathless NSA. For example, al Qaeda agent X, having phone FISA foreign surveillance, travels Pakistan New York. The FBI checks airline records determines returning Pakistan hours. Background information prepared document delivered attorney general. By time, agent X business plane Pakistan, NSA resume warrantless foreign surveillance. Because antiquated requirements FISA, surveillance agent X cease critical hours U.S. soil, presumably planning attack. Even time issue, emergency FISA application establish required probable cause 72 hours placing tap. So al Qaeda agent A captured Afghanistan agent B\\'s number cell phone, monitored NSA overseas. Agent B makes calls day agent C, flies New York. That chain facts, evidence, establish probable cause court believe C agent foreign power information terrorism. Yet, post 9/11, critics want NSA cease monitoring agent C landed U.S. soil? Why president ask Congress 2001 amend FISA address problems? My experience instructive. After TWA incident, I suggested asking Hill change law. A career Justice Department official responded, \"Congress political issue come away ability monitor.\" The political posturing Democrats suddenly found problems NSA program years supporting classified briefings confirms concern.

Without bill, manufacturers produced lead paint, example, held liable Wisconsin virtually lead poisoning -- plaintiff doesn\\'t need prove paint manufacturer, lead poisoning caused paint, opposed to, say, lead-contaminated soil lead pipes. \"These vetoes negate legislative efforts Wisconsin litigation capital America,\" said Ted Kanavas, state senator chairs committee aimed economic development Wisconsin. Gov. Doyle running re-election year widely expected tight race. His GOP opponents said they\\'d sign liability-reform bills elected. The stage set showdown. If Gov. Doyle triumphs, true winners lawyers. Three key legal issues stake election result governor\\'s vetoes. The relates admissibility expert testimony court. Under Wisconsin law, testimony admissible judge believes unreliable. Juries determine consider testimony. In words, junk science fully admissible Wisconsin. That policy -- created courts, corrected bill, retained Gov. Doyle\\'s veto -- enables researcher obesity case fast-food restaurant that, based single study rat behavior, cheeseburgers addictive heroin humans. Then case caps noneconomic damages medical malpractice cases. Injured plaintiffs recover actual damages, past 10 years, Wisconsin statute capped noneconomic damages (such pain suffering) $350,000, indexed inflation. Wisconsin\\'s insurance commissioner concluded early 2005 caps successful meeting legislative goals making malpractice insurance \"available affordable\" creating \"stable medical malpractice environment availability health care Wisconsin.\" As result, Wisconsin states judged American Medical Association medical malpractice crisis. But July, Wisconsin Supreme Court struck caps, substituting judgment Legislature arguing caps didn\\'t meet objectives legislation. The Legislature restored caps, Gov. Doyle vetoed that, too. The product-liability veto, though, caused consternation business circles. It started case J. Steven Thomas, claimed eaten paint chips containing lead pigment early 1990s. At time, lived rental housing built early 1900s, use lead-based paint common. Wisconsin ban lead-based paint 1980. Mr. Thomas, recovered $324,000 landlords\\' insurers sued seven lead pigment manufacturers damages. The case brought despite admission identify companies manufactured lead pigment paint allegedly ingested, identify seven defendants manufactured pigments involved. Historically, plaintiffs personal injury cases prove specific product manufactured specific defendant actually caused injury. But Wisconsin Supreme Court away rule July 2005 opinion written liberal Doyle appointee, held Mr. Thomas prevail prove defendants manufactured marketed lead pigments, pigments paint chips allegedly ate. The premise liability defendants participated industry contributed risk plaintiff. \"The end result majority opinion,\" argued dissenting justice, \"the defendants . . . held liable product produced, caused plaintiff\\'s injuries, based conduct occurred 100 years ago defendants relevant market.\" Another dissenter wrote case \"created remedy lead paint poisoning sweeping draconian nearly impossible paint companies defend or, frankly, plaintiffs lose.\" More lead cases virtually certain come, out-of-state trial bar descends Wisconsin. The Thomas case spearheaded firm Motley Rice LLC, based East Coast known nationwide representation plaintiffs cases involving lead tobacco. Finally, worse, ruling limits \"risk contribution\" theory lead pigment. It could, arguably, apply product. So surprise Chicago plaintiffs\\' firm recently filed case 13 Wisconsin companies alleging client died asbestos exposure, necessarily asbestos manufactured 13 named defendants.

He running bank months predecessor, William Harrison, 62, pulled job. Now Mr. Dimon tackling array challenges cases remained unaddressed years. J.P. Morgan\\'s branch network suffers big gaps fast-growing parts country, including Florida California, practically overseas-branch presence. Unlike rival Citigroup Wall Street titans, J.P. Morgan doesn\\'t retail securities brokerage, important piece puzzle bank trying broaden financial- services offerings. At time, J.P. Morgan struggling absorb series big acquisitions. A year half ago, bought Bank One $58 billion, job Mr. Dimon given integrate companies. However, quickly discovered unfinished business: \"The hardest thing merging J.P. Morgan Bank One merging J.P.

That merger encountered problems integrating companies\\' computer systems triggered corporate culture clash echoes bank\\'s Park Avenue headquarters. Mr. Dimon\\'s growth strategy marks significant cultural shift. He kicked aggressive program woo smaller corporate clients, calls returned J.P. Morgan recently years ago. Now, bankers Park Avenue head office, previously spent time biggest clients, dispatched small companies country pitch acquisition idea sell retirement plan. The overhaul helping increase profits business faces tremendous competition regional banks like Fifth Third Bancorp Cincinnati. J.P.

That partly result fact Bank One\\'s smaller corporate clients receiving attention. \"They quick come assure wouldn\\'t lost\" larger clients, says James Volker, chief executive Whiting Petroleum Corp., small oil-exploration company. The extra attention paid summer Mr. Volker turned J.P. Morgan $875 million loan, tapped investment bankers advice purchase oil fields hired bank lead stock-and-bond offering. The bank rapidly building new branches push broaden retail customer base. Last year opened 135 branches, including 59 December, small towns like Pickerington, Ohio, Bee Caves, Texas. This year, plans open 150. Still, 2,600 branches total, Bank America (5,800 branches) smaller rivals like Wachovia Wells Fargo. A critical initiative train branch employees aggressively sell walk-in customers bank\\'s credit cards mortgages. Banks notoriously bad this, started pay J.P. Morgan. The bank says branch sales credit cards rose 40% quarter ended Dec. 31. In past months, J.P. Morgan started pushing new cards aimed recent immigrants creditworthy borrowers. That challenging, J.P.

Since average stock price $300, units represent expense $150 million. Because units vest years, accounting rules require company count one- quarter cost expense year.

Still, Google ramping issuance stock units, future expense clearly rising. And Google shares trading steep 51 times expected 2006 per-share earnings -- times price-to-earnings ratio broader market -- drag earnings makes stock expensive. The performance-based stock units included Google\\'s quarterly securities filings, aren\\'t balance sheet, keeping accounting rules; price issuance stated. That makes harder investors tally cost.

       " 'RECENT NEWS ABOUT THE RISKS benefits menopause hormones focused heart, breast bone health. But important questions women want answered largely ignored. For years women believed taking menopause hormones, particularly estrogen, helped prevent wrinkles. But doctors dismiss notion menopause hormones affect skin\\'s appearance, noting there\\'s little scientific evidence theory. And women talk doctors, questions -- like breast-cancer risk heart health -- trump woman\\'s worries quality skin. But nearly years major government study scared women menopause hormones, wrinkle question resurfaced. Women stopped taking hormones complain skin different. They wonder newly discovered wrinkles appeared remained menopause hormones. New evidence shows menopause hormones probably protect skin effects aging -- depending woman starts taking them. Although questions health effects hormones remain unanswered, doctors need learn estrogen affects skin quality isn\\'t vanity. Anything protects skin protecting organs. \"The skin readily observable organ,\" says Hugh S. Taylor, associate professor Yale School Medicine department obstetrics, gynecology reproductive sciences. \"The skin best windows rest body. It reflect underlying medical conditions can\\'t see.\" And woman\\'s skin reflects dramatic changes body undergoing result menopause decline natural estrogen body. Estrogen likely plays role maintaining collagen hyaluronic acid, important components skin. But 30% collagen lost years menopause, hyaluronic acid declines age. Anecdotal reports animal studies suggested hormone therapy influence thickness collagen content skin, human studies inconclusive. Dr. Taylor researchers Yale University year attempted gauge effects menopause hormones woman\\'s skin. The researchers evaluated 65 candidates experienced menopause years earlier. Ultimately settled 20 women; 11 menopause hormones, long-time hormone users. The women comparable terms age, sun exposure, race, sunscreen use smoking history. Using documented wrinkle-evaluation system, women studied wrinkles 11 different parts face, including forehead lines, frown crease upper-lip wrinkles. To avoid subjective scoring variations, women evaluated plastic surgeon wasn\\'t aware hormones. When wrinkle scores tallied, non-hormone users scored 50% worse hormone users. Researchers conducted objective test measuring skin rigidity. Softer, pliable skin collagen likely wrinkle. Again, non-hormone users measured 50% worse forehead 2 1/2 times worse cheek measurements. The study, appeared August issue medical journal Fertility Sterility, far conclusive, particularly it\\'s based small study group. However, results support women doctors believed years: taking estrogen onset menopause significant effect woman\\'s face appearance. While sound like important health issue, doctors think is. If hormones slow aging process skin, it\\'s possible affect aging body. Even studies suggested breast cancer heart-attack risk higher hormone users, potential health benefits youthful skin shouldn\\'t dismissed, says Wake Forest University dermatologist Zoe Diana Draelos. In article accompanying Yale study, Dr. Draelos asked: \"Is depression experienced woman disconcerted facial appearance outweighed\" cardiovascular concerns? \"Would woman fewer wrinkles . . . exercise frequently . . . ?\" It\\'s clear exactly estrogen protect aging skin, estrogen drugs slow collagen loss affect skin\\'s ability retain water. Another theory connection estrogen fewer wrinkles linked bone health. Loss facial bone structure contributes wrinkles, estrogen known protect bones, prevent bone loss face, reducing wrinkles. Nobody believes women consider menopause hormones simply avoid wrinkles. But doctors believe skin protection potential benefits hormones considered women weigh risks treatment. The fact Yale study showed skin benefit longtime users fits notion timing hormone therapy difference it\\'s beneficial risky woman\\'s health. In recent years, data Women\\'s Health Initiative, studied hormone use older women, linked hormones higher risk heart attack, strokes health problems. But it\\'s important understand women WHI study started taking hormones late life, long menopause. The WHI results support theory hormones taken late life can\\'t repair damage aging -- it\\'s wrinkles heart disease -- likely things worse. However, remains open question hormones taken onset menopause actually lower risk heart health problems. A new study called Keeps, Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study, attempt answer question timing hormone use makes difference risks benefits. As study, Yale researchers plan continue studying effect menopause hormones skin quality. Dr. Taylor notes genetics important factor wrinkle. Sunlight, smoking healthful diet important variables determine skin ages.

That feature critical project -- families consider older adult joining household. \"I wanted [Mrs. Porterfield] flexibility space that, essentially, domain,\" Mr. Saint-Onge says. \"One key things came initial conversations loves crafts; loves puzzles creative things.

       " 'YOUR GREAT-UNCLE, haven\\'t seen decades, names sole beneficiary $500,000 estate. A windfall? That depends. While individuals inheritance brings financial relief, people finding infusions assets bring financial complications. \"There lot people large estates don\\'t want wealth,\" says Ronnie Powell, estate-planning lawyer Livingston, N.J. People estates valued higher federal estate-tax exclusion (which jumped $2 million year $1.5 million 2005) elaborate strategies place reduce bite taxes estates death. \"More assets create new, unwanted estate-planning challenges,\" Ms. Powell says. \"And end, next-in-line beneficiaries,\" usually children inheritors, \"get inheritance taxed twice -- grandparent\\'s death parent\\'s death.\" And cases, inheriting hard assets -- truckloads household goods -- logistical nightmare. All often, though, people don\\'t unwanted inheritance. If benefactor alive, people feel uncomfortable broaching subject, feeling it\\'s inappropriate presume getting inheritance discuss circumstances surrounding someone\\'s death. And death, inheritance arrives time mourning. \"People aren\\'t thinking financial-planning options, don\\'t know any,\" says Alan Augulis, estate-planning lawyer Warren Township, N.J. But steps avoid burden inheritance ensure value heirs maximized. If benefactor alive, drastic option simply request left will. Before going route, however, consider flexible, complicated, alternative: You ask benefactor, naming directly heir, instead establish \"generation-skipping trust\" -- names children beneficiaries. Such arrangment offers benefits. First, need arises, draw income trust, don\\'t assets outright. Second, don\\'t assets, property avoids estate taxes die. Finally, assets children don\\'t tap lifetimes passed subsequent generation free income taxes. If don\\'t children, generation-skipping trust set member younger generation family -- say, niece nephew. Again, trusts tricky -- haven\\'t escaped Uncle Sam\\'s attention. For example, assets placed generation-skipping trust exceed current estate-tax exclusion -- maximum year $2 million -- subject estate taxes 46%, generation-skipping tax 46%. In short: You\\'ll need lawyer. If it\\'s late advance planning receive unwanted inheritance, final option remains: You disclaim bequest, means formally decline accept it. To disclaim financial assets personal property real estate, submit signed letter executor estate stating intention. For house property, submit written letter records office deeds filed county real estate located. In case, letter submitted months death benefactor. In cases, disclaimer valid haven\\'t accepted inheritance. If cashed dividend check, example, ineligible disclaim property, Mr. Augulis says. However, inherit house living in, right disclaim property. If disclaim inheritance, don\\'t decide gets assets instead you. \"You\\'re treated predeceased grantor, assets secondary beneficiaries named will,\" Ms. Powell says. If secondary beneficiary, state law determines gets inheritance. As long assets beneficiaries -- say, children -- disclaimer usually preferable, financial standpoint, accepting assets gifting kids, Mr. Augulis notes. That\\'s gift certain year -- 2006 $12,000 recipient -- reduces giver\\'s estate-tax exclusion. So, instance, $100,000 gift child year reduce estate-tax exclusion die $88,000. With disclaimer avoid tax implications, assets end going want to, Mr. Augulis says. A disclaimer surviving spouse correct big oversight people estate plans. Here\\'s how: Take couple $4 million estate. Ideally, consider setting trust funded equal current $2 million estate-tax exclusion. Upon death spouse, trust gives surviving spouse right use money needed, assets pass children tax-free second spouse dies. This structure preserves assets kids, enables advantage estate-tax exclusions -- inherit trust tax-free $2 million estate second parent, tax-free. So ultimately children stand inherit entire $4 million having pay taxes it. Without trust, \"the kids exemption second spouse dies,\" Mr. Augulis says. In case, leave $2 million inheritance tax-free, $900,000 federal tax bill remaining $2 million. Many people haven\\'t set trust or, have, haven\\'t fully funded it. \"The estate-tax exclusion growing incrementally recent years, people haven\\'t keeping putting trusts,\" says Matt McGrath, financial planner Coral Gables, Fla. While exclusion $2 million, 2001 $675,000. By 2008 rise $3.5 million, 2011 sink 2002 level $1 million Congress changes law. (You consider state\\'s estate-tax exclusion funding trust.) But trust hasn\\'t set up, surviving spouse elect disclaim $2 million inheritance. Assuming kids named next-in-line beneficiaries, disclaimed assets straight children free federal estate taxes. (For children 18, disclaimed assets placed control guardian.) If trust set partially funded, disclaimer balance estate-tax exclusion; $1 million trust combined $1 million disclaimer, example. In case, surviving spouse dies, kids benefit second estate-tax exclusion, second spouse\\'s assets. For charity mind, disclaiming inheritance accept it, donate money.

Today we're semiretired, we've got boat, we're easy sailing distance beautiful anchorages. But experiences observations decades boating suggest life ads depict small -- small -- boating-in-retirement scenario. Let's talk ads don't show. The price tag, thing. Boats enormously expensive buy, operate, maintain, store insure. And expenses gotten worse past years hurricanes ravaged boats, marinas insurance industry, fuel prices soared. We sailboat owners like think expenses lower fuel-gulping powerboats, taking account expense maintaining replacing rigging sails time takes place another, differences probably aren't significant. Boats aren't exactly easy use, either, bigger (i.e., spacious comfortable) boat, harder use. Start 20-ton vehicle sitting asphalt parking lot, slippery surface water, subject movement currents wind.

Now try, current moving way wind pushing another, maneuver vessel narrow slip concrete posts, stopping precisely want hitting dock, getting multiple lines ashore secure place drifts something. If don't think that's hard, spend Saturday afternoon local marina watching weekend admirals returning berths. The husband-and-wife screaming matches suggest people turned boating life. Note, too, number boats berths. Many haven't left months. Even retirement, owners' busy schedules don't allow time use depreciating waterborne assets. Others don't leave dock because, pardon stereotypes, wife hates person husband step aboard. Finally, don't use boats simply they're scared them, rightly so. In 14 years we've owned Galaxie, 46-foot sailboat, we've share docking disasters close calls, we've learned all. No closer took delivery Galaxie Galveston August 1992 set sail home New York.

Every months Wall Street flirts hope Ford Motor General Motors presents new plan cut workers, close plants rejigger benefits. But moment fleeting, investors revert pessimism. The plant closings job cuts unlikely save companies, particularly GM, straits Ford. The Detroit mainstays solve problems selling better cars, course. But winning customers years, luxury GM doesn\\'t have. What\\'s needed radical solution breaks restructuring cycle saves GM. The United Auto Workers union says national health-care plan solve big chunk auto industry\\'s cost problems. But solution highly unlikely current political climate. So here\\'s idea: Transform GM\\'s workers retirees owners exchange benefit givebacks. Rod Lache, analyst Deutsche Bank, mulling plan save GM. Here\\'s work: GM pension liability $90 billion end 2004. Mr. Lache estimates GM health-care liabilities $65 billion. That\\'s $155 billion liabilities. The vast amount, all, attributable hourly, unionized workers. Now let\\'s look assets supporting obligations. The pension plan assets $90 billion end 2004. GM says investment gains 13% year, plan overfunded $6 billion. The health-care obligations underfunded tune $50 billion. (For purposes exercise, assume simply pension fund adequately funded. When GM reports 2005 year-end results tomorrow, easier assign more-accurate numbers these.) Mr. Lache proposes money socked away pensions health care auto workers. Then, proposes GM transfer GMAC, financing unit, workers. GMAC $23 billion book value. Add existing $15 billion long- term health-care trust, employees manage. The pension plan employee-run retirement plan. OK, amounts $128 billion assets, leaving workers far short $155 billion estimated liabilities. The plan needs sweetener: Give workers $20 billion GM equity. But GM\\'s market value $11 billion today. So, possible? After getting benefit costs, GM nimbler competitor. And throw plenty cash. Indeed, Mr. Lache estimates GM generate little $13 billion earnings interest, taxes, depreciation amortization year plan. The market company multiple times cash flow, Mr. Lache estimates, enterprise value (market capitalization plus gross debt) $63 billion. GM $32 billion debt remaining. There cash, exercise, allocate cash things like short-term health-care trust cover restructuring costs. There $31 billion equity value newly restructured company. The shareholders sacrifice potential upside restructuring avoid bankruptcy filing. Thus, GM\\'s market cap growing $31 billion $11 billion, let workers remaining $20 billion additional value created radical restructuring. In plan, workers $148 billion assets $155 billion owed. That amounts $250,000 value, average, roughly 600,000 active workers, retirees spouses covered pension plan. To sure, workers come short $7 billion older workers counting risky shares difficult industry reduced benefits. But what\\'s alternative? It\\'s probably years deterioration led bankruptcy. And shares provide chance upside. \"There universal recognition union owns majority enterprise. This crystallizes it,\" Mr. Lache says. The academic research suggests employee-ownership plans work best employees given management. It rarely tried grand scale. United Airlines majority owned employees, failed myriad reasons having ill- designed plan industry\\'s troubles. \"Just owning piece action affecting value value,\" says Avner Ben-Ner, professor industrial relations University Minnesota\\'s Carlson School Management.

Sarbanes-Oxley generally holds foreign companies U.S. listing registered Securities Exchange Commission standards. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act required companies strengthen corporate governance financial disclosure, international firms increased cost issuing shares U.S. Another factor shift U.S. stocks\\' underperformance relative foreign markets.

Companies choose list NYSE \"meet highest standards market anywhere,\" says Noreen Culhane, executive vice president charge listings Big Board. She argues lets sell stock higher price, puts higher value company. Companies tend list market believe shares best price. In years U.S. market rallying, New York tends attract foreign issuers, says Nancy Lissemore, director runs ADR GDR group Citigroup. That companies feel better price shares U.S. markets hot. Otherwise, ease London listing important. From 2000 2005, U.S. stock market outperformed issuing company\\'s local stock market, 87% capital raised foreign companies ADRs, Citigroup says.

They dubbed \"the General,\" homage irascible college basketball coach Bobby Knight. \"Larry vision win,\" said person Boston Scientific camp. Such combination impossible December 2004, J&J announced deal Guidant valued $76 share cash stock. The deal meant salve J&J\\'s declining growth rate, way medical giant diversify. It kind big-ticket deal industry\\'s largest players pull off. Reports Guidant product malfunctions surfaced soon thereafter, somewhat common occurrence given intricate technology biology involved. But bad news continued snowball, regulators began explore Guidant hid information doctors. With Guidant\\'s market share falling, J&J got nervous largest merger deal founding 1887. J&J played hardball Indianapolis-based Guidant, eventually winning 15% price cut $63 share mid-November. Even new price struck, J&J\\'s maneuvering raised eyebrows Natick, Mass., home Boston Scientific. Having examined Guidant deal years ago passed, company intrigued possibly taking advantage lower J&J bid. In early November, Mr. Nicholas Boston Scientific called Guidant counterpart, Chairman James M. Cornelius. He offered help raise Guidant\\'s price new lower offer. \"It pretty obvious Guidant worth $63,\" said Boston Scientific executive. Guidant, however, couldn\\'t budge binding contract J&J. Once J&J re-cut offer, Boston Scientific opening. A group executives, including Merrill Lynch bankers Shearman & Sterling lawyers, started convening Boston Scientific\\'s headquarters.

One Guidant official said Boston Scientific \"on treadmill\" didn\\'t obvious way company come top. \"J&J close gap,\" said. But anticipated lavish, $80-a-share bid ultimately proved knockout blow.

On Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday, Suzuki\\'s shares ended 1.6% 2,165 yen ($18.89), giving company market value $10 billion. Few success having Suzuki\\'s alliance GM, struggling U.S. car maker world\\'s largest auto producer.

Moreover, mounting shareholder pressure GM force unload shares Suzuki use proceeds shore money-losing operations North America. Jerome York, lieutenant big GM shareholder Kirk Kerkorian, fanned pessimism North American International Auto Show Detroit month called GM painful measures restructure. Mr. York grabbed headlines calls dividend cuts pay GM executives. Yet rattled investors Mr. York\\'s criticism GM\\'s strategy forming alliances car makers world. GM bailed alliances loss, Fiat SpA, Italy, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., Japan, maker Subaru brand. \"We know Fiat $2 billion debacle, Fuji Heavy Industries investment resulted $750 million write-down,\" Mr. York said. \"But foreign alliances? Are making money? Are generating cash? We don\\'t know GM doesn\\'t disclose sufficient information tell.\" GM affiliated Saab Opel, 7.9% stake Japanese truck maker Isuzu Motors Ltd.

But Suzuki ventures, GM sell pull rug Suzuki\\'s share price, hovering near record highs years strong performance. Christopher Richter, automotive analyst CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, says GM\\'s 21% stake Suzuki valued $2 billion, far big absorbed market causing significant downward pressure Suzuki\\'s stock price. (Mr. Richter doesn\\'t position Suzuki stock, CLSA seeks business companies analysts cover.) Suzuki little spare cash buy GM\\'s stake, investing heavily expanding operations markets India, venture Maruti Udyog Ltd. Some industry experts that, GM sells Suzuki\\'s shares, possible buyer stake Nissan Motor Co. Nissan wants produce cars India, arrangement sell 55,000 Suzuki-made cars annually Japan Nissan brand. Nissan says looking \"win-win\" deals declined comment further. Suzuki declined comment. One hurdle potential buyer: The stake won\\'t come cheap. Suzuki\\'s shares pricey, trading 18 times earnings per- share basis year ended March 31, 2005. At Toyota Motor Corp. comparable number 17, Honda Motor Co. trades multiple 12 times recent year\\'s earnings. Moreover, Suzuki run tough chief executive style doesn\\'t lend blending car companies. That reason arrangement GM fell short original promise. Given hurdles facing potential buyer, Mr. Richter concludes investors sell Suzuki shares. Some GM sell Suzuki stock buying opportunity. Suzuki\\'s stock expensive ties GM performs solidly own. Thus, GM sale Suzuki stock \"very little impact fundamentals business Suzuki, well-run company,\" says Norihito Kanai, fund manager Meiji Dresdner Asset Management Co. Tokyo. If Suzuki shares fall GM selloff, Mr. Kanai says \"significant opportunity buy Suzuki cheap.\" Suzuki isn\\'t listed exchanges outside Japan, U.S. investor buying stock broker Japan U.S. mutual fund investing Japanese shares. As investor, GM better Suzuki Fiat Fuji Heavy. GM says that, began affiliation Suzuki 1981, invested total $893 million stake valued $2 billion. Yet GM isn\\'t investment company, clear value Suzuki adds GM\\'s core car-making operations.

The devices implanted million patients U.S. year. Stent technology evolved markedly Dr. Wall roughed designs sketchpad 1984. No prototype stent, tested animals people. But Dr. Wall advisors argue patent covers stents market -- including top-selling drug-eluting devices marketed Johnson & Johnson Boston Scientific Corp.

After reading French mathematician\\'s opus celestial mechanics -- movements planets -- emperor asked treatise, unlike work Isaac Newton, mention God. Laplace reportedly replied, huff, need hypothesis. Ever since, science saddled canard arbitrarily priori rules existence deity. When Kansas board education deleted words \"natural explanations\" definition science year, like effort right supposed wrong. But attack science anti-God fighting mirage, secular religious scholars. \"It error arbitrarily insert God supernatural explanations scientific mysteries,\" says biologist Richard Colling evangelical Olivet Nazarene University, Bourbonnais, Ill. \"But equally unjustified claim science excludes God.\" As Barbara Forrest, philosopher science Southeastern Louisiana University, Hammond, explains, \"Science doesn\\'t rule priori. Saying false, makes science look dogmatic.\" Even heard Laplace, it\\'s easy idea science starts atheistic, agnostic, presumption. A report quasigovernmental National Academy Sciences says science \"is limited explaining natural world natural causes.\" The National Science Teachers Association says science \"cannot use supernatural causation explanations\" calls supernatural forces \"outside provenance.\" Although definitions sound science rules supernatural get-go, actually happens working scientists simply find entertaining supernatural explanation doesn\\'t far. In sense, argues Thomas Clark, director Center Naturalism, nonprofit educational group Somerville, Mass., \"Science doesn\\'t presume natural- supernatural distinction; generates it\" dividing works doesn\\'t. THE SUPERNATURAL dead end science strives testable explanations predictions: The sun rise east Earth spins west east, \"God wanted way.\" Since arrogant claim ability predict He (and likely struck dead hubris anyway), supernatural explanations fail science.

Consider hypothesis, \"Angry gods volcanoes erupt.\" It doesn\\'t -- predictively (how know god mad?) mechanistically (how angry god lava gas explode volcano?).

Grace\\'s carries vitaminwater flavor Bikoff beverage lines called fruitwater smartwater. What\\'s more, Mr. Doria says won\\'t sell brand enhanced health water -- PepsiCo Inc.\\'s Propel, nation\\'s seller. \"Darius first, I allegiance him.\" When comes making entrepreneurial dent markets dominated big giants, nonalcoholic-beverage category Mr. Bikoff company, Glaceau, competes toughest, costliest, crack. For starters, mainstream chain restaurants schools, sports stadiums, airports outlets strike exclusive contracts biggest suppliers -- Pepsi Coca-Cola Co. -- preclude selling competing beverages; return, typically lump-sum payments, discounts, coolers marketing support. Meantime, shelf space premium major supermarkets chains charge newcomers prohibitively expensive \"slotting fees\" mitigate supermarkets\\' risk pulling established product room untried. That leaves network smaller outlets Grace\\'s Marketplace game experiment, foot traffic. Yet story Glaceau\\'s vitaminwater offers insight inroads saturated industries, food toys office supplies cosmetics.

At time, Mr. Bikoff, money family metal-importing business, started dabble beverage category products: smartwater, plain bottled water, fruitwater, flavored version former. His thought simple: Why add vitamins water? The timing right. In terms volume growth, water drowning major beverage category milk soda beer. The word \"organic\" crept popular lexicon, consumers increasingly sought more-healthful alternatives diets, home out. And drinks function -- hydrate -- starting off.

Moreover, Mr. Bikoff insisted vitaminwater stocked alongside bottled water, didn\\'t think consumers understand product lumped soda sports-beverage sections.

For that, brand needs distribution -- way retailers\\' shelves ultimately consumers\\' hands. In beverage industry, small feat. Coke Pepsi hold enormous advantage bottling distribution operations (known respectively \"red\" \"blue\" networks) devoted solely delivering companies\\' products. The rest beverage world rely pool independent distributors -- \"white\" network -- divide attention dozens brands. And shrinking, Cadbury Schweppes PLC, owner 7 UP, Dr Pepper others, consolidating third-tier system umbrella. \"If real-estate business it\\'s location, location, location, beverage business it\\'s distribution, distribution, distribution,\" says John Sicher, editor publisher Beverage Digest. \"Coke, Pepsi Cadbury bottling networks venue country.\" The upshot smaller players land distributors\\' radars -- stay there. Tony Haralambos third-generation co-owner Haralambos Beverage Co., beverage distributor City Industry, Calif.

He expressed reservations dinner night Mr. Bikoff, smiled told planned sever relationships distributors Mr. Haralambos\\'s area. What\\'s more, Glaceau pay fees associated terminating contracts simply incremental business Mr. Haralambos. \"Well, that\\'s height flattery,\" says Mr. Haralambos. \"We deal night dinner.\" Months later, Mr. Bikoff flew team Haralambos headquarters, hired Beverly Hills caterer staged mock wedding Mr. Haralambos marched conference room greet distributor\\'s sales force.

PepsiCo rolling calcium-enhanced version Propel, SoBe division launch flavors SoBe LifeWater March. Coke clear sports drink called Powerade Option considers competitor category, isn\\'t technically water; spokesman Coke\\'s Dasani brands adds company exploring new options. That prospect hasn\\'t quenched Mr. Bikoff\\'s thirst. His current craving: crack dubs \"captive market\" -- accounts exclusive beverage contracts. Last fall, strolled Au Bon Pain downtown Manhattan introduced manager. \"We aren\\'t here, want here,\" Mr. Bikoff said waving arm open cooler stocked Pepsi, Aquafina Propel -- PepsiCo brands. He handed manager business card left, bemoaning calls \"restraint trade\" big players. \"It outrages me,\" says customary dramatic flair. \"It happens colleges, high schools, baseball stadiums, airports, places know 15 minutes eat won\\'t leave find drink.\" But vitaminwater prevalent -- 50,000 free-standing branded coolers nationwide high-traffic places Bed Bath & Beyond stores Virgin Megastore cafes -- tougher Mr. Bikoff assume role David battling Goliaths. His company track double $350 million 2005 revenue year, carries weight. In fact, weeks ago convinced Au Bon Pain executives discuss possibility adding Glaceau products chain. Meantime, smaller copycats popping regional markets, fortifying waters fiber herbs, suddenly it\\'s Mr. Bikoff protecting turf hungry upstarts ways ring faintly bigger rivals. Mr. Haralambos says edgy company called BooKoo Beverages, founded 2002, recently approached distributing vitamin- enhanced water.

For example, employers typically pay $3,284 single employee traditional insurance plan; covering employee high-deductible plan cost $2,850, according Kaiser Family Foundation. Even don\\'t contribute cent, employers tax benefits. And pay employees set aside year, bigger employers\\' tax breaks.

Only years in, great millennium primes.\" Ever Euclid proved infinitely primes (though sparser farther number line go), claims primes proliferated like rabbits. In cases, mathematicians know hearts claim true but, chagrin, can\\'t prove it. That bother inhabit rarefied world abstract math, discussion \"pseudo complex structure manifold X dimension 2N C-module structure tangent bundle\" counts small talk. But primes basis codes encrypt financial data national-security transmissions, making sure mathematicians\\' hunches primes actually true matters real world, too.

Yet primes\\' simplicity belies mystery. \"There basic questions prime numbers can\\'t answer, things think true can\\'t prove,\" says Prof. Goldston.

The expected deal, announced early week, settle investigations Securities Exchange Commission, New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, brought charges American International Group May, New York State Insurance Department. The payment include disgorgement allegedly ill- gotten gains penalties. The Wall Street Journal reported month AIG agreed pay $1 billion. The SEC\\'s piece settlement rival largest regulatory settlement agency signed. The SEC\\'s biggest settlement date WorldCom, later known MCI Inc., agreed pay $750 million settle accounting charges 2003. Last year, Mr. Spitzer reached $850 million agreement Marsh & McClennan Cos. settle bid-rigging allegations. In total dollars, expected AIG payment approach combined $2 billion paid Prudential Securities Inc. 1990s settle regulatory charges private litigation allegations misled investors risks rewards limited-partnership investments. If approved SEC commissioners, expected deal major settlement SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, took August. It comes weeks SEC announced framework determining seek penalty corporation. It isn\\'t clear expected deal divided terms disgorgement penalties. Under framework, SEC said considered factors, including shareholders corporation received unfair benefit result fraud degree penalty harm shareholders. Negotiations SEC AIG preceded announcement unclear new framework factors expected deal. The size expected deal comes authorities upped ante corporations caught allegations wrongdoing. KPMG agreed pay $456 million avoid prosecution selling allegedly abusive tax shelters deferred prosecution agreement Department Justice August. Last March, SEC fined Time Warner Inc. $300 million, time agency\\'s second-biggest fine WorldCom, owned Verizon Communications Inc., settle charges Time Warner overstated advertising revenue aided abetted securities frauds.

It $3 billion fines, restitution fee cuts dozen companies accepted settle allegations improper mutual-fund trading cheated investors. For AIG, settlement wrap case loomed year.

The likely deal expected include payments AIG owes state workers\\' compensations funds, addition penalties restitution investors, people familiar situation said. It outline changes business governance practices, AIG implemented past year. The SEC hasn\\'t filed charges AIG; expected file settle allegations accounting fraud simultaneously. A spokesman AIG declined comment potential settlement\\'s size timing. The company talks state federal authorities months. Last year executed internal review business practices restated years financial results acknowledging accounting errors. The settlement won\\'t include individuals named New York case -- Mr. Greenberg Howard I. Smith, AIG\\'s chief financial officer. Attorneys representing men said wrong plan fight charges court.

       " 'WHEN PICKING INVESTMENTS, economy don\\'t want look stupid. Forecasting U.S. economic expansion year looks particularly tricky: Will Iran\\'s nuclear standoff send oil prices skyrocketing -- rising oil stockpiles prices steady? If consumers\\' appetite toys -- flat-panel TVs, expensive handbags -- wanes, spending businesses economy humming? For millions small investors, answers questions crucial try figure extra cash year stock funds, stuff money-market account instead. Even pros struggling read tea leaves. We asked top-rated mutual-fund managers pulse economy. They represent different money-management styles based different regions country. Each run fund 10 years, witnessing stock-market booms busts, racked returns superior peers. While don\\'t agree economy perform year, consumer spending dropping. Most think businesses pick slack, don\\'t agree much. These managers economy expanding faster clip half year second, year-end expansion totaling little 2% 3.5%. Their forecast bit bearish consensus economists, expansion 3.25%, according The Wall Street Journal\\'s annual economic-forecasting survey, conducted December. Commerce Department figures showed U.S. economy expanded 1.1% fourth quarter, hurt slower consumer spending, economists predicting sharp rebound. These fund managers tend stock market muddling year single-digit returns. They energy companies, commodity producers technology firms faring best. Consumer- goods makers, retail stores financial-service businesses, especially tied mortgage market, look vulnerable. But, Ron Muhlenkamp, manager $3.2 billion-in-assets Muhlenkamp Fund, puts it, \"in economics, everybody fears rarely happens.\" Instead, wild card like Iran. The managers interviewed Manu Daftary, manager $900 million Quaker Strategic Growth Fund; William Frels, runs $2.6 billion Mairs & Power Growth Fund; William Nasgovitz, manager $1.6 billion Heartland Value Fund; Robert Rodriguez, charge FPA Capital Fund, $2.1 billion portfolio. Here developments watching signs ahead: OVER A BARREL: Aside obvious benefits major oil companies, fund managers agree high energy costs represent biggest threat country\\'s economic expansion. But high high? Despite oil prices surged $70 barrel summer, economy continued chug along, defying expectation economists recalled toxic mix inflation slower expansion, known stagflation, unleashed prices spiked 1970s. With strong demand energy China fear potential supply disruptions volatile oil-producing nations like Iran Nigeria, oil experts predict energy prices set new records year. If price oil, $65.37 barrel, $60 summer, Mr. Frels says reassess prospects economy year. \"That dampen consumer spending,\" says. \"The longer high oil prices, greater effect inflation rate, greater likelihood Fed continue raise interest rates\" ward higher inflation. Mr. Muhlenkamp fears combination higher oil prices steeper interest rates says chances recession year 20%, oil prices rates continue going up. \"That slow things down,\" says. \"But outside surprise bring recession.\" While high energy prices translating higher heating costs, Mr. Daftary sees price gasoline pump critical variable. If families start paying $4 gallon gasoline, \"that debilitating effect.\" THE CONSUMER\\'S CHOICES: Economists consumer spending barely increased fourth quarter, fund managers bracing fall year. That decline increasingly evident higher energy costs mean expensive heating costs country. Mr. Muhlenkamp says surveys indicate eating out, going movies spending clothes main areas susceptible cutbacks. In particular, keeping eye retailers report fourth-quarter results. \"We\\'re confident able predict areas affected,\" says. \"So we\\'re watching data.\" Many managers look financial statements signs consumers tightening belts. Mr. Frels keeps eye restaurants dining out. He isn\\'t seeing lot tables. Mr. Rodriguez notes rate increase personal income fell inflation rate end year, trend expects continue year cause consumer finicky. He says residential investment percentage gross domestic product highest level ever. \"Consumers large percentage assets category inflated,\" says. \"Any kind correction big implications spending.\" The managers note mortgage- refinancing boom coming end: Many homeowners refinanced low rates increases interest rates additional refinancings appealing, big source money buoy economy drying up. Mr. Daftary counts \"For Sale\" signs suburban Boston neighborhood detect country\\'s hotter housing markets cooling down. He seen signs -- sticking longer period. \"That tells housing prices high,\" says. BEYOND THE BOTTOM LINE: Corporate earnings going golden age. Operating earnings share companies Standard & Poor\\'s 500-stock index risen 90% past years, according Citigroup Inc. (Operating earnings exclude gains losses net income calculated generally accepted accounting principles.) The consensus forecast calls earnings year jump 13% 2005, according Thomson Financial. That represent unprecedented fourth straight year double-digit profit increases. Rather zeroing line, Mr. Muhlenkamp focuses line. Revenue expansion, unlike profits, can\\'t aided cost cutting accurate gauge state economy, says. He predicts revenue increases blue-chip companies year average 3.5%, indicates GDP expansion same. Some managers focused money companies spend factories, information systems investments. As consumers feel confident, business spending pick slack offset drop consumer\\'s appetite. Mr. Frels suggests looking big diversified companies like General Electric Co. 3M Co. capital expenditures. He sees moves window U.S. companies doing. Despite GE\\'s disappointing earnings released month, remains relatively upbeat. \"There lot noise fourth quarter,\" says. \"But basic business well, especially sectors tied economy.\" THE DOLLAR\\'S DIRECTION: Last year, U.S. currency enjoyed biggest gains 2001, rising 15% euro yen. While stronger dollar helps lid inflation U.S. encouraging importation cheaper goods abroad, makes U.S. products competitive abroad, making expensive relative European Japanese goods. A sudden rapid decline dollar bad U.S. economy capital markets, shock likely provoke foreign investors pull dollar-denominated securities. But repeat gradual retreat dollar experienced 2002 2004 benefit U.S. exporters. In case, Mr. Daftary says, \"you higher earnings estimates agricultural companies like Archer-Daniels-Midland (Co.) commodity producers.\" Mr. Nasgovitz notes price gold climbed 25-year high recently. Although gold dollar rallied year, sharp spike price precious metal historically coincided weaker U.S. currency inflation. \"It\\'s negative stocks price gold goes roof,\" says. ASIA\\'S APPETITE: Commodity prices took 2005: The Dow Jones-AIG Index 20 commodities jumped 18%. Much rise fueled exploding demand China India oil natural resources supply rapidly expanding economies. Mr. Frels thinks demand continue lift prices variety commodities raw materials, trend costly U.S. companies. That mean inflation -- pressure Fed continue raising interest rates. At time, keeping eye Asian appetite U.S. debt. Japan largest foreign holder U.S. Treasury bonds, Tokyo\\'s buying debt fell dramatically year -- Bank Japan wasn\\'t intervening weaken currency buying dollars selling yen -- China helped pick slack. Chinese net purchases U.S. Treasury debt stood $35.3 billion 11 months 2005, according latest U.S. government figures, making 2005 China\\'s biggest year purchases. Economists Asian demand U.S. Treasury debt big reason long-term rates remained low, investors worry significant diversification countries\\' debt result higher U.S. bond yields, which, turn, slow economy. YIELDING DIRECTION: In Treasury-bond market, difference yield short-term debt long-term debt small, phenomenon known flat yield curve. In December, yield two-year note briefly exceeded 10-year note. That development known yield-curve inversion, indicates economic downturn, recession, looming. That investors usually demand payment governments companies tie money longer periods. So willing accept lower yield, suggests believe Fed, raised target short-term rate 4.5% week, soon bring rates ward recession. Some managers, like Mr. Frels, yield-curve inversion matters interest rates relatively low levels. In case, curve flattens long-term rates come faster short-term ones risen. This benign long- short-term rates rising, pressuring economy slow. Mr. Rodriguez thinks flattening yield curve signals slower expansion ahead entire economy, particularly worrisome financial sector. There, isn\\'t merely signal, hindrance core lending activities. When short-term long- term rates same, companies can\\'t borrow low short-term rates lend higher long-term rates, pocketing difference profit. Instead, riskier loans credit-worthy borrowers decent spread. \"We\\'re likely number financial-services firms difficult earnings,\" Mr. Rodriguez says. WASHINGTON WORRIES: This election year, 435 House seats one-third Senate seats play. Republicans expected retain majorities chambers. But lobbying scandals caused House Majority Leader Tom DeLay leadership post led political pundits suggest majorities thinner November election. That matters managers think pro-business legislation likely pass Republican majority whittled down. Mr. Nasgovitz says uncertainty Washington head wind stock market, thinks Bush Administration\\'s tax cuts extended current political climate. \"That drag economy,\" says. Mr. Daftary thinks Congress does, better, legislation tends matters worse. A divided Congress suit fine. Still, thinks sign White House U.S. moving closer bringing troops Iraq offer psychological lift market rev consumer confidence. OTHER TEA LEAVES: During 1990s, Mr. Muhlenkamp recalls, comments like Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan\\'s famous warning stock market responding \"irrational exuberance\" gradually gave way pundit claims market going \"this time different.\" These assurances began peak time stock prices 2000. For now, analysts financial journalists writing furiously housing-market bubble, happen bursts. Mr. Muhlenkamp scanning headlines find pundits argue, instead, conditions changed, prices going higher. \"When guys making warnings tired shouted start keeping mum,\" says, \"that\\'s it\\'s over.\" --- Journal Link: See additional data mutual-fund performance rankings, Online Journal WSJ.com/YourMoney.',\n",

The target rehabilitation effort expected Mark Koenig, Enron\\'s head investor relations. As government\\'s witness landmark criminal trial began federal court week, Mr. Koenig spent days stand saying lied public Enron\\'s financial condition business operations nearly years energy giant\\'s December 2001 collapse bankruptcy proceedings.

While certain individuals pleaded guilty caught crime, pleaded \"guilty reluctantly order save greater exposure deep don\\'t believe wrong,\" says Mr. Hardin, veteran Houston defense attorney. The challenge, adds, identify individuals gently coax belief witness stand. He acknowledges, however, multiple cooperating witnesses lined government makes defense\\'s task difficult.

In testimony week, Mr. Koenig clear won\\'t easily convinced innocence. When prosecutor Kathryn Ruemmler said suggested wasn\\'t guilty, Mr. Koenig replied \"I wish I agree it. But I guilty.\" Mr. Koenig said plea bargain mistakenly taken blame statement Mr. Skilling 2001. After finishing Mr. Koenig, defense scheduled face second government cooperating witness, Kenneth Rice, senior Enron executive close associate Mr. Skilling\\'s. Besides questioning validity Mr. Rice\\'s guilty plea, defense attorneys likely explore testimony Enron-related trial year.
